abstract = {Recent research has indicated that interactions between behavioral inhibition system (BIS)/behavioral activation system (BAS) sensitivity and emotion regulation (ER) difficulties increases risk for psychopathology. Considering sleep quality (SQ) has been linked to emotion regulation difficulties (ERD) and psychopathology, further investigation of a possible mechanism is needed. The current study examined associations between BIS/BAS sensitivity, ERD, and SQ to depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in an undergraduate sample (n=459). Positive relationships between BIS sensitivity and both ERD and stress symptoms, and negative relationships between BAS-reward sensitivity and both ERD and depression symptoms were observed. Furthermore, ERD were positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Succeeding analyses revealed differential relationships between ERD and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among good quality and poor quality sleepers. The findings are discussed within the context of personality dimensions and self-regulatory mechanisms, along with implications for the treatment of depression, anxiety and sleep difficulties. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

abstract = {This paper explores memoing in the context of qualitative research methodologies. The functions of memos in the research process are discussed and a number of techniques for employing memo writing to enhance the research experience and outcomes are examined. Memoing is often discussed in the literature as a technique employed in grounded theory research, yet there is limited exploration of the value of memo writing in qualitative methodologies generally. Memoing serves to assist the researcher in making conceptual leaps from raw data to those abstractions that explain research phenomena in the context in which it is examined. Memos can be effectively employed by both the novice and experienced researcher as a procedural and analytical strategy throughout the research process. Data explo-ration is enhanced, continuity of conception and contemplation is enabled and communication is facilitated through the use of memoing. While guidelines exist to aid in the production and use of memos, memoing remains a flexible strategy wherein the process of construction and nature of content is determined by the preferences and abilities of the researcher and the aims and focus of the specific research study.},

abstract = {Objectives: The present investigation was designed to test the predictions of a control theory based view of self-regulation on the complex effects of self-efficacy on persistence. Specifically, self-efficacy was predicted to have a positive effect on persistence given unambiguous feedback, but a weak, negative effect given ambiguous feedback. Moreover, the research was designed to replicate an influential set of studies on self-efficacy. Design: A 2 (self-efficacy: low, high) × 2 (feedback ambiguity: low, high) between-groups ANOVA was conducted to examine the interaction between self-efficacy and feedback ambiguity in two trials of an isometric hand-grip competitive endurance task. Method: Participants (87 females and 67 males) competed on a hand-grip strength task against confederates who claimed to have overworked their hand (high manipulated self-efficacy) or to be tennis players (low manipulated self-efficacy). The competition occurred either in the presence (high feedback ambiguity) or absence (low feedback ambiguity) of a physical barrier between the individuals. Persistence was how long individuals could grip at 50{\%} of their maximum voluntary contraction. Results: The interaction was significant and in the predicted direction. Self-efficacy was also found to negatively relate to self-reported effort regardless of condition. Conclusions: The results from the current study confirm that self-efficacy can foster persistence when one is aware of one's current state of performance. However, consistent with a control theory view of self-regulation, self-efficacy was unrelated to persistence when feedback was ambiguous. The results have implications for understanding the role of self-efficacy in sports and highlight the importance of replications with extensions.},

abstract = {Perfectionism is a major diagnostic criterion for one DSM-III diagnosis, and it has been hypothesized to play a major role in a wide variety of psychopathologies. Yet there is no precise definition of, and there is a paucity of research on, this construct. Based on what has been theorized about perfectionism, a multidimensional measure was developed and several hypotheses regarding the nature of perfectionism were tested in four separate studies. The major dimension of this measure was excessive concern over making mistakes. Five other dimensions were identified, including high personal standards, the perception of high parental expectations, the perception of high parental criticism, the doubting of the quality of one's actions, and a preference for order and organization. Perfectionism and certain of its subscales were correlated with a wide variety of psychopathological symptoms. There was also an association between perfectionism and procrastination. Several subscales of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS), personal standards and organization, were associated with positive achievement striving and work habits. The MPS was highly correlated with one of the existing measures of perfectionism. Two other existing measures were only moderately correlated with the MPS and with each other. Future studies of perfectionism should take into account the multidimensional nature of the construct.},

@article{Walker2018a,
abstract = {Background: The widely used OpenPrescribing.net service provides standard measures which compare prescribing of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and English General Practices against that of their peers. Detecting changes in prescribing behaviour compared with peers can help identify missed opportunities for medicines optimisation. Automating the process of detecting these changes is necessary due to the volume of data, but challenging due to variation in prescribing volume for different measures and locations. We set out to develop and implement a method of detecting change on all individual prescribing measures, in order to notify CCGs and practices of such changes in a timely manner. Methods: We used the statistical process control method CUSUM to detect prescribing behaviour changes in relation to population trends for the individual standard measures on OpenPrescribing. Increases and decreases in percentile were detected separately, using a multiple of standard deviation as the threshold for detecting change. The algorithm was modified to continue re-triggering when trajectory persists. It was deployed, user-tested, and summary statistics generated on the number of alerts by CCG and practice. Results: The algorithm detected changes in prescribing for 32 prespecified measures, across a wide range of CCG and practice sizes. Across the 209 English CCGs, a mean of 2.5 increase and 2.4 decrease alerts were triggered per CCG, per month. For the 7578 practices, a mean of 1.3 increase and 1.4 decrease alerts were triggered per practice, per month. Conclusions: The CUSUM method appears to effectively discriminate between random noise and sustained change in prescribing behaviour. This method aims to allow practices and CCGs to be informed of important changes quickly, with a view to improve their prescribing behaviour. The number of alerts triggered for CCGs and practices appears to be appropriate. Prescribing behaviour after users are alerted to changes will be monitored in order to assess the impact of these alerts.},

abstract = {The thesis is written as four chapters detailing five studies through which the impact of overseas expeditions was investigated. Study 1 (Chapter 2) examined the effects of expeditions on the multidimensional self-esteem domains of youth participants. Results demonstrated significant and positive differences in post-test self-esteem domain scores for expedition participants compared with a control group. One of the multi-source data collections (i.e., the leader team) corroborated the significant effect for general self-esteem at post-test. However, only one significant maintenance effect was found for the self-esteem domain of honesty/trustworthiness at six months follow-up. In Study 2 (Chapter 3) an existing differentiated measure of transformational leadership was amended to provide a contextually relevant measure for use in the expedition setting, that is, the Expedition-DTLI (E-DTLI). The study was divided into three phases. Phase 1 explored the factorial validity of the new measure; following confirmatory factor analysis procedures and item deletion an acceptable model fit was provided, supporting a 7-factor structure. Phase 2 confirmed the factor structure, and phase 3 explored and confirmed the predictive validity of the E-DTLI. Taken together these results provide initial evidence that the E-DTLI is a valid measure for use in the expedition context. Using the E-DTLI, Study 3 (Chapter 4) examined the impact of transformational leadership (TL) on the multidimensional self-esteem domains of youth expedition participants. Regression analyses revealed that the hypothesised TL behaviours (intellectual stimulation, individual consideration) were significant predictors of certain self-esteem domains (e.g., general self-esteem, honesty/trustworthiness). Other predictive relationships that were not hypothesised were also evident (e.g., high performance expectations predicting general self-esteem). These results were used to inform Study 4 (Chapter 5) where a pilot TL training intervention was implemented. Results from the pilot indicated no significant difference in the experimental (intervention) group's TL behaviours at post-test in comparison to the control group's TL behaviours. However, the experimental group's TL behaviours significantly increased pre to post test. Subsequent review of Study 4 led to amendments in content and design of the intervention, resulting in the development of a full-scale intervention (Study 5). Results for Study 5 (Chapter 5) demonstrated that the TL intervention had a significant and positive impact on experimental expedition leaders' TL behaviours compared to the control group. When examining the self-esteem domains of the youth participants being led by the leaders, only the honesty/trustworthiness domain was significantly higher for the experimental leader group in comparison to the control group.},

Confirmatory factor analysis revealed evidence for the factorial and discriminant validity of the leadership inventory. Furthermore, results demonstrated that the leadership behaviors of fostering acceptance of group goals and promoting team work, high performance expectations, and individual consideration significantly predicted task cohesion; and fostering acceptance of group goals and promoting teamwork significantly predicted social cohesion. Performance level moderated these relationships. These results are discussed with reference to the conceptualization and measurement of transformational leadership, and how coaches' leadership behaviors may influence cohesion depending on the level of athletes' performance.

A lack of understanding regarding the expectations and responsibilities associated with a particular position represents a construct referred to as role ambiguity. Role ambiguity has been considered to influence both the performance effectiveness of teams and shown to be associated with the psychosocial well-being of team members including athlete satisfaction and anxiety. A conceptual model of role ambiguity for interactive sport teams has been developed by Beauchamp, Bray, Eys, and Carron (2002). This conceptual model was adapted to the sport environment from work by Kahn et al. (1964) in industrial/organizational literature. In this adapted model for interactive sport teams, the potential for ambiguity is assumed to be possible in both a defensive and offensive context. Further, in each context, there are four manifestations or dimensions of ambiguity that could potentially occur. The first, Scope of Responsibilities, reflects a lack of clear information regarding the general extent of the athletes' responsibilities.},

Exercises were completed thrice weekly for 12 weeks, during dialysis in the haemodialysis patients. Outcomes included knee extensor muscle volume by magnetic resonance imaging, knee extensor strength by isometric dynamometer and lower body tests of physical function. Data were analysed by a per protocol method using between-group comparisons.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: PRET elicited a statistically and clinically significant anabolic response in haemodialysis patients (PRET-SHAM, mean difference [95 {\%} CI]: 193[63 to 324] cm(3)) that was very similar to the response in healthy participants (PRET-SHAM, 169[-41 to 379] cm(3)). PRET increased strength in both haemodialysis patients and healthy participants. In contrast, PRET only enhanced lower body functional capacity in the healthy participants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Intradialytic PRET elicited a normal anabolic and strength response in haemodialysis patients. The lack of a change in functional capacity was surprising and warrants further investigation.},

This review evaluates current understanding of deliberate practice in sport skill acquisition with an emphasis on the role of deliberate practice in distinguishing expert athletes from non-experts. In particular, we re-examine the original tenets of Ericsson et al.'s framework to (a) evaluate the sport-related research supporting their claims and (b) identify remaining research questions in this area. The review highlights the overall importance of deliberate practice in the development of expert sport performers; however, our understanding is far from complete. Several directions for future research are highlighted, including the need for more rigorous research designs and statistical models that can evaluate changes in developmental and contextual factors across development. Finally, we advocate for a more thorough understanding of the implications of a ‘deliberate practice approach' for coaching science.},

Fifty male and 62 female manufacturing employees (age range 16-55 years) assigned scores to each item on a slightly modified version of the LEI scale. The current sample consistently assigned higher weights to events/items than did the original sample, but there was high agreement in terms of item ranking. Some distinct age and gender differences in scoring were apparent, and are discussed further. It was concluded that when separate weightings are employed for age and gender groups, the LEI remains a useful tool for quantifying background levels of stress in both workplace stress audits and epidemiological studies where statistical control for non-occupational sources of stress is required.},

Supporting self-determination theory postulates (Ryan {\&} Deci, 2000)—autonomy, competence, and relatedness, were consistently among the top 4 needs, in terms of both their salience and their association with event-related affect. Self-esteem was also important, whereas self-actualization or meaning, physical thriving, popularity or influence, and mbney-luxury were less important. This basic pattern emerged within three different time frames and within both U.S. and South Korean samples and also within a final study that asked, "What's unsatisfying about unsatisfying events?"

Results showed that the AI discrepancy was consistently related with the hypothesized tripartite components of depressive affect and with symptoms of clinical depression. In sharp contrast the AOO discrepancy was unrelated to tripartite components of anxious affect and with shyness.

abstract = {BACKGROUND—Oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinomas caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with favorable survival, but the independent prognostic significance of tumor HPV status remains unknown. METHODS—We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between tumor HPV status and survival among patients with stage III or IV oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy (with acceleration by means of concomitant boost radiotherapy) with standard-fractionation radiotherapy, each combined with cisplatin therapy, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Proportional-hazards models were used to compare the risk of death among patients with HPV- positive cancer and those with HPV-negative cancer. RESULTS—The median follow-up period was 4.8 years. The 3-year rate of overall survival was similar in the group receiving accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy and the group receiving standard-fractionation radiotherapy (70.3{\%} vs. 64.3{\%}; P = 0.18; hazard ratio for death with accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy, 0.90; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.13), as were the rates of high-grade acute and late toxic events. A total of 63.8{\%} of patients with oropharyngeal cancer (206 of 323) had HPV-positive tumors; these patients had better 3-year rates of overall survival (82.4{\%}, vs. 57.1{\%} among patients with HPV-negative tumors; P{\textless}0.001 by the log-rank test) and, after adjustment for age, race, tumor and nodal stage, tobacco exposure, and treatment assignment,had a 58{\%} reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95{\%} CI, 0.27 to 0.66). The risk of death significantly increased with each additional pack-year of tobacco smoking. Using recursive- partitioning analysis, we classified our patients as having a low, intermediate, or high risk of death on the basis of four factors: HPV status, pack-years of tobacco smoking, tumor stage, and nodal stage. CONCLUSIONS—Tumor HPV status is a strong and independent prognostic factor for survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer.},

abstract = {Objectives: To examine several psychological mechanisms mediating the efficacy of goal setting in endurance sports. Design: The athletes were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions in a 2×2×3 mixed design. Methods: Participants were 35 male endurance athletes ranging in age from 15 to 34 years who competed at different athletic clubs of the Catalonian Track and Field Federation. They were assigned to a goal (attainable or unattainable) and pattern of social comparison (win or lose) conditions, which were the between subject variables, and phase of assessment (three repetitions) served as the repeated-measure variable. Results: To analyze the role of mediator mechanisms, a structural equation modeling analysis was conducted. The results indicated that both motivational and emotional mechanisms were important mediators in improving the efficacy of goal setting in endurance sports. In particular the addition of the concept of suffering (including perceptions of threat and feelings of helplessness) was shown to be related to performance outcomes. Conclusions: When setting goals, the possibility of not reaching those goals can be threatening to individuals and lead to feelings of helplessness, especially if goals are perceived as too difficult. Having strong self-efficacy to meet the goals set is important to maintain motivation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study examined the effects of exercise imagery on implicit and explicit attitudes towards exercise and the moderating effect of exercise status. It was predicted that exercise imagery would activate a pattern of positive automatic associations with exercise that would be reflected in more positive implicit attitudes. Corresponding effects were expected for explicit affective attitudes, but imagery was not expected to influence explicit instrumental attitudes. Design: A post-test only comparison group design. Method: Participants (N=160; 40 male and 40 female frequent exercisers, 40 male and 40 female less frequent exercisers) were randomly allocated, stratified by exercise status and gender, to undergo either guided imagery of a pleasant experience of exercising or a comparison imagery condition. Participants then completed an Implicit Association Test, measures of explicit affective and instrumental attitudes, and an imagery manipulation check. Results: There were significant main effects for experimental condition and exercise status on implicit attitudes, with more positive attitudes in the exercise imagery condition and for more frequent exercisers. There were significant main effects for exercise status on explicit affective and instrumental attitudes. Exercise status did not moderate the effects of imagery on implicit or explicit attitudes. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate that implicit attitudes to exercise can be modified, although only immediate effects were assessed. Future research should assess the generalisability of the findings in less active populations and examine the effects of repeated imagery on implicit attitudes to determine whether it could have more lasting effects and impact on actual exercise behaviour.},

abstract = {In this chapter we describe some of the details of the computational methods for fitting linear mixed models, as implemented in the lme4 package, and the theoretical development behind these methods.We also provide the basis for later generalizations to models for non-Gaussian responses and to models in which the relationship between the conditional mean, µ, and the linear predictor, $\gamma$ =X$\beta$ +Zb=Z$\Lambda$$\theta$u+X$\beta$, is a nonlinear relationship. This material is directed at those readers who wish to follow the theory and methodology of linear mixed models and how both can be extended to other forms of mixed models. Readers who are less interested in the “how” and the “why” of fitting mixed models than in the results themselves should not feel obligated to master these details. We begin by reviewing the definition of linear mixed-effects models and some of the basics of the computational methods, as given in Sect. 1.1},

abstract = {Avalanches are a serious problem across the Alps even more in the latest years, considering the number of people playing outdoor activities on snow areas. Dissemination of information across those stakeholders involved in all warning and rescue services is crucial at each stage. This paper figures out how people involved in risk mitigation might be allowed to fill this gap and exchange information in a common language both in term of contents and contexts without any kind of misleading. Furthermore, several user-oriented services might be acted on Web channels to reach mountaineers via mobile devices and make their experience safe-effective. GeoAvalanche is an open-source project aimed at sharing information on snow avalanche (such as bulletins, incidents, snow-profile, weather observations{\ldots}) with a common standard in order to build a Spatial Data Infrastructure for cross-border interoperability and early warning alert systems toward a safe mitigation risk of mountain activities across the Alps. The GeoAvalanche server has the OGC Web Feature Service capabilities to enable common warning services for snow avalanche information exchanges in compliance with CAAML (Canadian Avalanche Association Markup Language) specification (adopted by the avalanche community as an international standard) and map visualization services for incident report and bulletin alert. 1},

abstract = {Objective: The study aimed to develop a perceived autonomy support scale for exercise settings (PASSES) in young people. Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Methods: In Study 1,432 school pupils responded to an initial pool of perceived autonomy support items with physical education (PE) teachers as the source of support. The validity of the initial factor structure of the PASSES was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. In Study 2, three versions of the PASSES were developed measuring perceived autonomy support from three sources: PE teachers, parents, and peers. British (N=210), Estonian (N=268), and Hungarian (N=235) school pupils completed each version. The proposed model of perceived autonomy support established in Study 1 was tested for structural invariance and mean differences across the three cultures. Results: In Study 1, the deletion of items contributing to model misspecification produced a final 12-item PASSES which exhibited acceptable fit with the data. The perceived autonomy support factor also demonstrated discriminant and convergent validity with regulation styles from the perceived locus of causality. In Study 2, the hypothesized model exhibited acceptable goodness-of-fit statistics in all samples and for all sources. The structure of the model was found to be invariant across the cultural groups for each source. Contrary to hypotheses, mean levels of perceived autonomy support from parents and peers were found to be higher in Estonian participants relative to their British and Hungarian counterparts. Conclusion: Results support the use of the PASSES as a valid measure of perceived autonomy support in exercise settings for three different sources in young people. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Previous studies suggest that self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism show differential relationships with intrinsic–extrinsic motivation and test anxiety, but the findings are ambiguous. Moreover, they ignored that test anxiety is multidimensional. Consequently, the present study re-investigated the relationships in 104 university students examining how the two forms of perfectionism are related to intrinsic–extrinsic motivation and multidimensional test anxiety (worry, emotionality, interference, lack of confidence, and total anxiety). Regarding motivation, self-oriented perfectionism showed positive correlations with intrinsic reasons for studying, and socially prescribed perfectionism positive correlations with extrinsic reasons. Regarding test anxiety, only socially prescribed perfectionism showed positive correlations with total anxiety. Moreover, socially prescribed perfectionism showed positive correlations with interference and lack of confidence, whereas self-oriented perfectionism showed positive correlations with worry, but negative correlations with interference and lack of confidence. The findings confirm that socially prescribed perfectionism is a maladaptive form of perfectionism associated with extrinsic motivation for studying and higher anxiety in exams. Self-oriented perfectionism, however, is an ambivalent form associated with intrinsic motivation for studying and with both higher and lower anxiety (higher worry; lower interference, lower lack of confidence) in exams.},

abstract = {Self-determination theory maintains and has provided empirical support for the proposition that all human beings have fundamental psychological needs to be competent, autonomous, and related to others. Satisfaction of these basic needs facilitates people's autonomous motivation (i.e., acting with a sense of full endorsement and volition), whereas thwarting the needs promotes controlled motivation (i.e., feeling pressured to behave in particular ways) or being amotivated (i.e., lacking intentionality). Satisfying these basic needs and acting autonomously have been consistently shown to be associated with psychological health and effective performance. Social contexts within which people operate, however proximal (e.g., a family or workgroup) or distal (e.g., a cultural value or economic system), affect their need satisfaction and type of motivation, thus affecting their wellness and effectiveness. Social contexts also affect whether people's life goals or aspirations tend to be more intrinsic or more extrinsic, and that in turn affects important life outcomes.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Two studies were conducted to translate and validate this new measure in English. The Sport Motivation Scale (SMS) consists of seven subscales that measure three types of Intrinsic Motivation (IM; IM to Know, IM to Accomplish Things, and IM to Experience Stimulation), three forms of regulation for Extrinsic Motivation (Identified, Introjected, and External), and Amotivation. The first study confirmed the factor structure of the scale and revealed a satisfactory level of internal consistency. Correlations among the subscales revealed a simplex pattern confirming the self-determination continuum and the construct validity of the scale. Gender differences were similar to those obtained with the French-Canadian version. The more self-determined forms of motivation were associated with more positive responses on related consequences. In a second study, the SMS was administered on two occasions and revealed adequate test-retest reliability.},

It aims to ensure that trauma-exposed personnel are properly supported and encouraged to seek timely help should they develop mental health problems that fail to resolve spontaneously., AIMS: To summarize current knowledge about TRiM and make recommendations for further research., METHODS: A search of PsychINFO, CINAHL and PubMed identified 13 published papers., RESULTS: TRiM outcomes were represented in different ways within the relevant studies suggesting that TRiM may have effects additional to those that it seeks to achieve. For example, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that TRiM had a specific positive occupational effect and did no harm; a qualitative study suggested that TRiM enhanced liaison between mental health workers and line managers and a service evaluation suggested that it reduced sickness absence. In general, the process appears to enhance trauma-exposed personnel's reliance on peer support and TRiM was reportedly acceptable and sustainable., CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that TRiM's utility has moved beyond the military to other organizations where personnel risk occupational traumatic exposure. Further research would help to understand how TRiM is perceived by line managers and how it functions within the trauma-prone populations.Copyright {\textcopyright} The Author 2015.

@article{Gigerenzer2011,
abstract = {As reflected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efficient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do "rational" decisions as defined by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question ("Which heuristics do people use in which situations?") and the prescriptive question ("When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?"), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.},

abstract = {The present investigation was designed to test the predictions of Bandura's (1977) theory of self-efficacy in a competitive, motor-performance situation. Subjects (30 males and 30 females) were randomly assigned to either a high or low self-efficacy condition in a 2 × 2 × 2 (sex × self-efficacy × trials) factorial design. Self-efficacy was manipulated by having subjects compete against a confederate on a muscular leg-endurance task where the confederate was said to be either a varsity ;rack athlete who exhibited higher performance on a related task (low self-efficacy) or an individual who had a knee injury and exhibited poorer performance on a related task (high self-efficacy). Because self-efficacy theory predicts that expectation-performance differences are maximized in the face of obstacles and aversive consequences, the experiment was rigged so that subjects lost in competition to the confederate on both trials. The results supported self-efficacy predictions with the high self-efficacy subjects extending their legs significantly longer than low self-efficacy subjects. Moreover, after failing on the first trial, high self-efficacy subjects extended their legs for a longer time than low self-efficacy subjects on the second trial. A postexperimental questionnaire revealed significant differences in cognitive states (e.g., expectations, attributions, self-talk) between high and low self-efficacy subjects, as well as between males and females. Results are discussed in terms of learned helplessness and differing patterns of sex-role socialization.},

Furthermore, optimism has costs after feedback-participants who predicted higher scores before feedback felt worse after learning their scores. Finally, people seem to be aware of the potential costs of optimism-participants who predicted higher scores before feedback also anticipated experiencing greater disappointment should they perform poorly. These findings suggest that people may proactively manage their expectations to avoid the costs of optimism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While resilience has been defined as resistance to illness, adaptation, and thriving, the ability to bounce back or recover from stress is closest to its original meaning. Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving. PURPOSE: To test a new brief resilience scale. METHOD: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients. RESULTS: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without fibromyalgia. CONCLUSION: The BRS is a reliable means of assessing resilience as the ability to bounce back or recover from stress and may provide unique and important information about people coping with health-related stressors.},

However, inclusion of too many variables leads to downward bias of regression coefficients and decreases precision. When the correlations are low, inclusion of auxiliary variables is not useful.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: More research on auxiliary variables in multiple imputation should be performed.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Risk assessment is an important part of safe backcountry travel in avalanche terrain. The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the ability of backcountry travelers to accurately estimate the avalanche danger for their destination and time of travel.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We surveyed 353 winter backcountry users, asking them to rate the avalanche danger for their destination that day. We then compared this estimation to the Utah Avalanche Center daily advisory for that specific location, aspect, and elevation. Tendency to underestimate the avalanche danger was then compared across 6 different sports (backcountry skiing, backcountry snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, out-of-bounds skiing, and out-of-bounds snowboarding) as well as across age, gender, and subject participation in an avalanche safety course.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A comparison across different sports, adjusted for age and gender, showed that snowshoers were 7.11 times more likely than skiers to underestimate the avalanche danger (95{\%} CI, 2.95, 17.11). This difference was maintained after adjusting for past education in an avalanche safety course (odds ratio, 5.74; 95{\%} CI, 2.28, 14.46). Snowmobilers were also significantly more likely to underestimate the avalanche danger when compared to skiers (odds ratio, 3.11; 95{\%} CI, 1.12, 8.24), but these differences ceased to be significant when the data were adjusted for avalanche safety course (odds ratio, 2.39; 95{\%} CI, 0.84, 6.74). While there was a trend for women and older age groups to underestimate the avalanche danger when compared to men, these trends were not significant.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Snowshoers and snowmobilers are groups that tend to underestimate avalanche danger when traveling in the backcountry. These groups may be unknowingly assuming a higher risk and should be targeted for avalanche education and awareness.},

abstract = {The use of Gis in avalanche assessment is widely adopted, it performs analysis which help to make decisions in land management. The aim of this work was to apply different tools, provided by a GIS software, for the study and management of the avalanche risk in the Region of Valle d'Aosta (north-west of Italy) and in the ski resort "Piancavallo" in Friuli Venezia Giulia Region (north-east of Italy). As a goal and also a starting point for further processes, a geodatabase of the Regional Avalanche Inventory was created and divided into several raster datasets, feature datasets and feature classes related to avalanches. Then, within the Interreg project Italy-Switzerland "STRADA”, still in progress, strategies for the avalanche hazard mitigation were found, focusing in particular on roads crossed by avalanche paths. That was reached by assessing a procedure, obtained interpolating (geoprocessing) features related to avalanches, roads and buildings, which provides a useful tool to identify the sites that might be suitable for artificial avalanche triggering. This process could help in avoiding the preventive closure of roads, and such application can be the starting point for more detailed analysis, necessary to provide decision- making to local governments in emergency management. Finally, a methodology, processed from digital terrain models, allowed the identification of the potential release areas in the Piancavallo ski-resort realized through various steps in geoprocessing environment, or through file .aml of Arc Info Workstation.},

Despite its importance, there are serious challenges associated with producing reliable and high-quality forecasts—especially when there are a variety of time series and analysts with expertise in time series modeling are relatively rare. To address these challenges, we describe a practical approach to forecasting “at scale” that combines configurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment.

In Study 1, the three scales comprising the DASS were shown to have excellent internal consistency and temporal stability. An exploratory factor analysis (principal components extraction with varimax rotation) yielded a solution that was highly consistent with the factor structure previously found in nonclinical samples. Between-groups comparisons indicated that the DASS distinguished various anxiety and mood disorder groups in the predicted direction. In Study 2, the conceptual and empirical latent structure of the DASS was upheld by findings from confirmatory factor analysis. Correlations between the DASS and other questionnaire and clinical rating measures of anxiety, depression, and negative affect demonstrated the convergent and discriminant validity of the scales. In addition to supporting the psychometric properties of the DASS in clinical anxiety and mood disorders samples, the results are discussed in the context of current conceptualizations of the distinctive and overlapping features of anxiety and depression.},

abstract = {Objectives: Robust confidence beliefs (the ability to maintain confidence beliefs in the face of adversity) have been highlighted as an important characteristic that contributes to the make up of mentally tough athletes. The purpose of the present set of studies was to develop such a measure. Design: Three studies are reported that chart the development of a measure of Trait Robustness of Self-Confidence (i.e., the ability to maintain confidence in the face of disconfirming experiences). Method: Study 1 developed a 12-item inventory that was subjected to single-factor confirmatory factor analysis used in an exploratory fashion. Results: The factor structure of the resultant eight-item inventory (TROSCI) was consistent across both male and female athletes (S-B $\chi$2 (20)=29.75; CFI=.98; RMSEA=.04; SRMR=.03). The single-factor structure of the eight-item inventory was confirmed in a second study that demonstrated structural (S-B $\chi$2 (20)=29.36; CFI=.97; RMSEA=.05; SRMR=.04) and convergent validity (S-B $\chi$2 (188)=244.83; CFI=.98; RMSEA=.05; SRMR=.06) with Vealey's TSCI. Finally, Study 3 demonstrated the predictive validity of TROSCI; high TROSC athletes were associated with more stable self-confidence levels prior to competition. Further, athletes with high TROSC levels managed to maintain higher state self-confidence levels than those with low TROSC levels. Conclusions: Results support the view of robust confidence beliefs and highlight other factors that may play a moderating role. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.

With such a varied body of work, the task for researchers, practitioners and policy makers of generating a clear understanding of what is known and what is thought to be true regarding the development of sporting talent is par- ticularly challenging. Drawing on a wide array of expertise, we address this challenge by avoiding adherence to any specific model or area and by providing a reasoned review across three key overarching topics: (a) the performer; (b) the environment; and (c) practice and training. Within each topic sub-section, we review and calibrate evidence by performance level of the samples. We then conclude each sub-section with a brief summary, a rating of the quality of evidence, a recommendation for practice and suggestions for future research.These serve to highlight both our current level of understanding and our level of confidence in providing practice recommendations, but also point to a need for future studies that could offer evidence regarding the complex interactions that almost certainly exist across domains.

Efficacy was manipulated by having subjects compete against a confederate on a muscular leg-endurance task where the confederate was said to be either a varsity track athlete (low-manipulated self-efficacy) or an individual who had had knee surgery (high-manipulated self-efficacy). To create aversive consequences, the experiment was rigged so that subjects lost in competition on the two muscular leg endurance task trials they performed. Both preexisting and manipulated self-efficacy were found to significantly influence performance, with preexisting self-efficacy influencing performance only on Trial 1 and manipulated self-efficacy only on Trial 2. The findings support Bandura's (1977) theory of self-efficacy and are discussed in terms of the permeability of initial efficacy states.},

abstract = {The twin challenges of inactivity and the 2012 Olympics have tightened the focus in UK sport promotion. However, the twin track approach which treats these challenges as distinct concerns may limit the efficacy of interventions in either area. We propose that a continuum between participation, performance sport and elite achievement represents the most efficacious and logical focus for practitioners and researchers alike. We explore the genesis of this, and other problematic features through critical consideration of key theories. Finally, we propose a multidimensional approach to lifelong sport and activity participation as a theoretically justified basis for research and intervention design. ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER},

Graduating from cross-sectional to longitudinal designs enables researchers to make more rigorous inferences about the causal relations implied by such models. In this transition, misconceptions and erroneous assumptions are the norm. First, we describe some of the questions that arise (and misconceptions that sometimes emerge) in longitudinal tests of mediational models. We also provide a collection of tips for structural equation modeling (SEM) of mediational processes. Finally, we suggest a series of 5 steps when using SEM to test mediational processes in longitudinal designs: testing the measurement model, testing for added components, testing for omitted paths, testing the stationarity assumption, and estimating the mediational effects.},

@article{Faraway2002,
abstract = {There are many books on regression and analysis of variance. These books expect different levels of preparedness and place different emphases on the material. This book is not introductory. It presumes some knowledge of basic statistical theory and practice. Students are expected to know the essentials of statistical inference like estimation, hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. A basic knowledge of data analysis is presumed. Some linear algebra and calculus is also required. The emphasis of this text is on the practice of regression and analysis of variance. The objective is to learn what methods are available and more importantly, when they should be applied. Many examples are presented to clarify the use of the techniques and to demonstrate what conclusions can be made. There is relatively less emphasis on mathematical theory, partly because some prior knowledge is assumed and partly because the issues are better tackled elsewhere. Theory is important because it guides the approach we take. I take a wider view of statistical theory. It is not just the formal theorems. Qualitative statistical concepts are just as important in Statistics because these enable us to actually do it rather than just talk about it. These qualitative principles are harder to learn because they are difficult to state precisely but they guide the successful experienced Statistician. Data analysis cannot be learnt without actually doing it. This means using a statistical computing package. There is a wide choice of such packages. They are designed for different audiences and have different strengths and weaknesses. I have chosen to use R (ref. Ihaka and Gentleman (1996)). Why do I use R The are several reasons. 1. Versatility. R is a also a programming language, so I am not limited by the procedures that are preprogrammed by a package. It is relatively easy to program new methods in R . 2. Interactivity. Data analysis is inherently interactive. Some older statistical packages were designed when computing was more expensive and batch processing of computations was the norm. Despite improvements in hardware, the old batch processing paradigm lives on in their use. R does one thing at a time, allowing us to make changes on the basis of what we see during the analysis. 3. R is based on S from which the commercial package S-plus is derived. R itself is open-source software and may be freely redistributed. Linux, Macintosh, Windows and other UNIX versions are maintained and can be obtained from the R-project at www.r-project.org. R is mostly compatible with S-plus meaning that S-plus could easily be used for the examples given in this book. 4. Popularity. SAS is the most common statistics package in general but R or S is most popular with researchers in Statistics. A look at common Statistical journals confirms this popularity. R is also popular for quantitative applications in Finance. The greatest disadvantage of R is that it is not so easy to learn. Some investment of effort is required before productivity gains will be realized. This book is not an introduction to R. There is a short introduction in the Appendix but readers are referred to the R-project web site at www.r-project.org where you can find introductory documentation and information about books on R . I have intentionally included in the text all the commands used to produce the output seen in this book. This means that you can reproduce these analyses and experiment with changes and variations before fully understanding R . The reader may choose to start working through this text before learning R and pick it up as you go. The web site for this book is at where data de- scribed in this book appears. Updates will appear there also. Thanks to the builders of R without whom this book would not have been possible.},

abstract = {Lock of consensus regarding the nature and conceptual definition of the social support construct has led to a plethora of different forms of measurement of this psychosocial variable, many with psychometric limitations. Beyond the psychometric limitations of some measures, in sport there is also a need for measures to be relevant to the specific experiences of sports performers. In order to gain a greater understanding of the social support experiences of sports people, 10 high-level sports performers were interviewed regarding their experiences of social support. Principles of the grounded theory (Glaser {\&} Strauss, 1967) approach were adopted for analysis of their responses and insights. Four dimensions of support were generated, within each of which were comments relating to sport-specific support and comments relating to support not directly concerning the sport itself. The dimensions were labeled emotional, esteem, informational, and tangible. Example quotes are given to highlight each dimension of support, and implications for intervention are derived.},

This article outlines an alternative approach based on interpretive research methods. Interpretative approaches are usually associated with qualitative social science but are equally applicable to the analysis of quantitative data. In interpretive quantitative research, statistics are used to shed light on the unobservable data generating processes that underlie observed data. Key tenets of interpretive quantitative methodology are the triangulation of research results arrived at by analysing data from multiple perspectives, the integration of measurement and modelling into a more holistic process of discovery and the need to think reflexively about the manner in which data have come into existence. Interpretive quantitative research has the potential to yield results that are more meaningful, more understandable and more applicable (from a policy standpoint) than those achieved through conventional positivist approaches.},

Recent research within the social-cognitive framework illustrates adaptive and maladaptive motivational patterns, and a research-based model of motivational processes is presented that shows how the particular performance or learning goals children pursue on cognitive tasks shape their reactions to success and failure and influence the quality of their cognitive performance. Implications for practice and the design of interventions to change maladaptive motivational processes are outlined. It is suggested that motivational patterns may contribute to gender differences in mathematics achievement and that empirically based interventions may prevent current achievement discrepancies and provide a basis for more effective socialization.

Locus of Control theory evolved from Bandura's Social Learning Theory, which posits that observed and imitated behaviors are either reinforced through reward or extinguished through punishment. Locus of Control falls on a continuum, with those who believe that their life is largely controlled by outside forces (externals) falling on one end of the spectrum while those who believe that by and large they control their own lives (internals) falling on the other end. As I have discovered in my research, locus of control can be used to predict things from psychological well-being to health behaviors, from academic and economic success to reaction to hardships},

The foundations of Bayesian estimation and inference are first reviewed. Then, two empirical examples are provided to show how Bayesian methods can overcome limitations of frequentist methods: (a) a structural equation model of testosterone's effect on status in teams, where a Bayesian approach allows directly testing a traditional null hypothesis as a research hypothesis and allows estimating all possible residual covariances in a measurement model, neither of which are possible with frequentist methods; and (b) an ANOVA-style model from a true experiment of ego depletion's effects on performance, where Bayesian estimation with informative priors allows results from all previous research (via a meta-analysis and other previous studies) to be combined with estimates of study effects in a principled manner, yielding support for hypotheses that is not obtained with frequentist methods. Data are available from the first author, code for the program Mplus is provided, and tables illustrate how to present Bayesian results. In conclusion, the many benefits and few hindrances of Bayesian methods are discussed, where the major hindrance has been an easily solvable lack of familiarity by organizational researchers.},

Method: Participants included 185 children (age = 11.38 ± 1.12 years; body mass index = 20.66 ± 4.13 kg/m(2)): 107 children with asthma and 78 healthy children. To test the enjoyment of physical activity, PACES of Motl et al. was used in its Spanish version. In addition, the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C), Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) and Physical Self-Concept Questionnaire (CAF) have been used. Results: The results have shown a two-factor structure corresponding to the model whose settings have been good. PACES internal consistency was very high (Cronbach's alpha = 0.906). The PACES test-retest reliability indicates a good temporal concordance (Spearman rho = 0.868, p {\textless} 0.001). This presents an adequate concurrent validity with the total PAQLQ, the PAQ-C as well as with ability, fitness, attractiveness, strength and general physical self-concept. Conclusions: The findings confirm that PACES is a valid and reliable measure of physical activity enjoyment in children with asthma.},

DESIGN: The method consisted of a set of 24 paired scenarios, which were imaginary patient cases, each containing three different ethical indicators randomly selected from a list of indicators (for example, child, rich patient, severe disease etc.). The scenarios were grouped into 12 random pairs and the procedure was repeated four times, resulting in 12 scenario pairs arranged randomly in five different sets. SURVEY: This method was tested with four groups of subjects (n = 8, n = 47, n = 104 and n = 36). RESULTS: Children and patients with a severe disease were prioritised in all groups. The aged, patients with a mild disease and patients with a self-acquired disease were negatively prioritised in all groups. Poor or rich patients were prioritised in some groups but negatively prioritised in others. CONCLUSIONS: The validity and reliability of this method are good and it is suitable for investigating attitudes towards medical prioritisation.},

abstract = {The article describes the development and validation of the 30-item Computer User Self-efficacy (CUSE) Scale. Self-efficacy beliefs have been identified as a factor which may contribute to the success with which a task is completed. Because of the increasing reliance on computer technologies in all aspects of life, it is important that the construct is measured accurately and appropriately. In particular, the article focuses on the measurement of computer self-efficacy in student computer users and its relevance to learning in higher education. The scale was found to have high levels of internal and external reliability and construct validity. Results also showed there to be significant positive correlations between CSE and computer experience, familiarity with computer software packages (which were significant predictors of CSE) and that owning a computer and computer training increased CSE. In addition, males showed significantly higher CSE than females. It is suggested that the scale may be used to identify individuals, in particular students, who will find it difficult to exploit a learning environment which relies heavily on computer technologies. Once identified, motivational and personal control issues can be addressed with these individuals.},

abstract = {Background Athletes' psychological characteristics are important for understanding sports injury mechanisms. We examined the relevance of psychological factors in an integrated model of overuse injury risk in athletics/ track and field. Methods Swedish track and field athletes (n=278) entering a 12-month injury surveillance in March 2009 were also invited to complete a psychological survey. Simple Cox proportional hazards models were compiled for single explanatory variables. We also tested multiple models for 3 explanatory variable groupings: an epidemiological model without psychological variables, a psychological model excluding epidemiological variables and an integrated (combined) model. Results The integrated multiple model included the maladaptive coping behaviour self-blame (p=0.007; HR 1.32; 95{\%} CI 1.08 to 1.61), and an interaction between athlete category and injury history (p{\textless}0.001). Youth female (p=0.034; HR 0.51; 95{\%} CI 0.27 to 0.95) and youth male (p=0.047; HR 0.49; 95{\%} CI 0.24 to 0.99) athletes with no severe injury the previous year were at half the risk of sustaining a new injury compared with the reference group. A training load index entered the epidemiological multiple model, but not the integrated model. Conclusions The coping behaviour self-blame replaced training load in an integrated explanatory model of overuse injury risk in athletes. What seemed to be more strongly related to the likelihood of overuse injury was not the athletics load per se, but, rather, the load applied in situations when the athlete's body was in need of rest.},

abstract = {Recent research has indicated that interactions between behavioral inhibition system (BIS)/behavioral activation system (BAS) sensitivity and emotion regulation (ER) difficulties increases risk for psychopathology. Considering sleep quality (SQ) has been linked to emotion regulation difficulties (ERD) and psychopathology, further investigation of a possible mechanism is needed. The current study examined associations between BIS/BAS sensitivity, ERD, and SQ to depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in an undergraduate sample (n=459). Positive relationships between BIS sensitivity and both ERD and stress symptoms, and negative relationships between BAS-reward sensitivity and both ERD and depression symptoms were observed. Furthermore, ERD were positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Succeeding analyses revealed differential relationships between ERD and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among good quality and poor quality sleepers. The findings are discussed within the context of personality dimensions and self-regulatory mechanisms, along with implications for the treatment of depression, anxiety and sleep difficulties. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {There is extensive evidence that personality traits are associated with health-related behaviours, but less evidence regarding the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we examined the relationships between personality and self-determination of exercise behaviour. Users of a sports centre completed personality scales (the NEO Five Factor Inventory supplemented with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Psychoticism scale) and exercise self-determination scales (Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire which measures extrinsic, introjected, identified and intrinsic forms of regulation). Analyses were restricted to 182 individuals in the maintenance stage of exercise participation. Partial correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships between each personality scale and the self-determination scales, controlling for other personality scales, gender and age. Neuroticism was associated with more introjected regulation, extraversion with more identified and intrinsic regulation, openness with less external regulation, conscientiousness with less external regulation and more intrinsic regulation, and psychoticism with more external regulation. Relating these findings to self-determination theory (Deci {\&} Ryan, 2000), it is speculated that extraverted individuals are able to feel self-determined because exercise can satisfy the need for relatedness, conscientious individuals because exercise can satisfy the need for competence. Furthermore, conscientious individuals may have greater wherewithal to advance along the continuum of behavioural regulation. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many diagnostic tools and goodness-of-fit measures, such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian deviance information criterion (DIC), are available to evaluate the overall adequacy of linear regression models. In addition, visually assessing adequacy in models has become an essential part of any regression analysis. In this paper, we focus on a spatial consideration of the local DIC measure for model selection and goodness-of-fit evaluation. We use a partitioning of the DIC into the local DIC, leverage, and deviance residuals to assess local model fit and influence for both individual observations and groups of observations in a Bayesian framework. We use visualization of the local DIC and differences in local DIC between models to assist in model selection and to visualize the global and local impacts of adding covariates or model parameters. We demonstrate the utility of the local DIC in assessing model adequacy using HIV prevalence data from pregnant women in the Butare province of Rwanda during 1989-1993 using a range of linear model specifications, from global effects only to spatially varying coefficient models, and a set of covariates related to sexual behavior. Results of applying the diagnostic visualization approach include more refined model selection and greater understanding of the models as applied to the data.},

To evaluate the instrument's pshychometric properties, we administerde the 50-item EAI with a five-component model of empathy to a sample of 773 undergraduate students and community members. We evaluate the EAI psychometrics conducting internal consistency, test-retest, and confirmatory factor analyses. Findings indicate that a 17-item five-factor model of the EAI offers the best fit [CFI= .98; RMSEA=.04 (90{\%} CI (.03; .05); WRMR= .80]. The data do not support using empathic attitudes as a proxy for actions; however, the findings suggest the EAI functions better when measuring a four-factor model, offering an important implication for future research.},

Thirty studies with a total sample size of 15,609 met the inclusion criteria to be used for the current meta-analysis. Results indicated that overall, estimated average correlation coefficients for resilience were: r = −0.46 with Neuroticism, r = 0.42 for Extraversion, r = 0.34 for Openness, r = 0.31 for Agreeableness, and r = 0.42 for Conscientiousness. When comparing the differences between the two types of resiliency, a stronger negative relationship with Neuroticism, and stronger positive relationships with Openness and Agreeableness were obtained with ego-resiliency, compared with trait resilience. However, there was a lack of homogeneity in effect sizes across studies especially for ego-resilience. Directions for future research regarding resilience and the limitations of present research are discussed.},

Zajonc's (1965) drive theory of social facilitation, the mere presence of others increases arousal and, thereby, the frequency of dominant responses (i.e., responses with the greatest habit strength). In the present experiment, U.S. undergraduates performed a stimulus discrimination task under 1 of 2 conditions: in the presence of another individual (audience) or alone. The mere presence condition was designed to make it difficult for the participants to attend directly to the audience. The task was designed to minimize the likelihood that the specific response (numerical preference) would be attributable to a desire to respond appropriately to the audience. There was a significant difference in the mean number of dominant responses between the participants in the audience condition and those in the alone condition. The results provide support for Zajonc's mere presence drive theory of social facilitation.},

abstract = {Automatic imitation is a cornerstone of nonverbal communication that fosters rapport between interaction partners. Recent research has suggested that stable dimensions of personality are antecedents to automatic imitation, but the empirical evidence linking imitation with personality traits is restricted to a few studies withmodest sample sizes. Additionally, atypical imitation has been documented in autismspectrum disorders and schizophrenia, but the mechanisms underpinning these behavioural profiles remain unclear. Using a larger sample than prior studies (N=243), the current study tested whether performance on a computerbased automatic imitation task could be predicted by personality traits associated with social behaviour (extraversion and agreeableness) and with disorders of social cognition (autisticlike and schizotypal traits). Further personality traits (narcissismand empathy) were assessed in a subsample of participants (N=57). Multiple regression analyses showed that personality measures did not predict automatic imitation. In addition, using a similar analytical approach to prior studies, no differences in imitation performance emerged when only the highest and lowest 20 participants on each trait variable were compared. These data weaken support for the view that stable personality traits are antecedents to automatic imitation and that neural mechanisms thought to support automatic imitation, such as the mirror neuron system, are dysfunctional in autism spectrum disorders or schizophrenia. In sum, the impact that personality variables have on automatic imitation is less universal than initial reports suggest.},

Within the class, the correlation between latent factors can be as high as 1.0, and as low as the correlation between certain component scores. The models are indistinguishable in terms of parameter parsimony, identifiability, and fit statistics, implying that interfactor correlation is not identifiable within the class.

abstract = {Public avalanche information has traditionally focussed on avalanche forecasts that provide avalanche danger ratings and contain information about weather, snowpack, and avalanche conditions. Recent developments in Canada include the adoption of a standardized conceptual approach for avalanche hazard analysis; better integration of the information pyramid in public avalanche forecasts; and development of advanced software (AvalX) that fully integrates the hazard analysis process with avalanche forecast production. Improvements in traditional public avalanche forecasting have reached the point of diminishing returns and future efforts to improve public avalanche information and decision- making aids need to focus elsewhere. Making informed and educated choices about when and where to travel in mountainous areas requires linking avalanche hazard with terrain. To date, terrain components in public avalanche information products are limited. Tools that combine hazard and terrain have been developed but only rudimentary efforts have been made to utilize the power of computer, the internet, and mobile applications. This paper presents ideas for a better integration of terrain with hazard using online and mobile applications. The proposed approach will provide users with educational opportunities to help understand risk and practical tools to determine the potential risk of a given trip on a given day. This will result in more efficient trip planning and better informed terrain and route choices in the field.},

abstract = {Objectives: To investigate the ways in which participation in physical activity is prevented or facilitated among older people with acquired sight loss later in life. Study design: Qualitative research. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 48 visually impaired adults age 60+ years, recruited from a range of settings including local sight loss organisations and via talking newspaper advertisements. Visual impairment was defined by self-report. Data was analysed using a thematic analysis. This research represents a first step toward the development of empirically based practical suggestions for decision-makers and health professionals in terms of supporting - when required - visually impaired older adults participation in physical activity. Results: Six themes were identified that captured why physical activity was prevented or facilitated: disabling environments; organisational opportunities; transport; lack of information; confidence, fear and personal safety; and exercise as medicine. Conclusions: Recommendations for policy change need to be focused at the societal level. This includes developing more accessible and inclusive environments and providing meaningful information about physical activity to older adults with a visual impairment, and visual impairment in older age to physical activity providers.},

There exists wide variation in the way chil-dren respond to toxic stressors in their lives. Some children appear to be relatively unaffected, while others develop a variety of psychological, behavioral, and physical conse-quences. What is the explanation for this phenomenon? Resil-iency has been suggested to explain this variation in pathology expressions in trauma-exposed children. It is vital for pediatric nurse practitioners to understand the concept of resilience.

In most domains of expertise, individuals begin in their childhood a regimen of effortful activities (deliberate practice) designed to optimize improvement. Individual differences, even among elite performers, are closely related to assessed amounts of deliberate practice. Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent are actually the result of intense practice extended for a minimum of 10 yrs.

abstract = {The mixed models considered in the previous chapter had only one random-effects term, which was a simple, scalar random-effects term, and a single fixed-effects coefficient. Although such models can be useful, it is with the facility to use multiple random-effects terms and to use random-effects terms beyond a simple, scalar term that we can begin to realize the flexibility and versatility of mixed models. In this chapter we consider models with multiple simple, scalar random-effects terms, showing examples where the grouping factors for these terms are in completely crossed or nested or partially crossed configurations. For ease of description we will refer to the random effects as being crossed or nested although, strictly speaking, the distinction between nested and non-nested refers to the grouping factors, not the random effects. 2.1 A Model With Crossed Random Effects One of the areas in which the methods in the lme4 package for R are particu-larly effective is in fitting models to cross-classified data where several factors have random effects associated with them. For example, in many experiments in psychology the reaction of each of a group of subjects to each of a group of stimuli or items is measured. If the subjects are considered to be a sample from a population of subjects and the items are a sample from a population of items, then it would make sense to associate random effects with both these factors. In the past it was difficult to fit mixed models with multiple, crossed grouping factors to large, possibly unbalanced, data sets. The methods in the lme4 package are able to do this. To introduce the methods let us first consider a small, balanced data set with crossed grouping factors.},

For external validity, generalizing results, treating partners and studies as well as participants as random is strongly encouraged. For construct validity, particularly the psychological meaning of measures, multivariate models that treat measures from both overtime and dyadic data as being a combination of multiple constructs are discussed. For conclusion validity or valid statistical inference, the problem of low power when generalizability is high and the assumption of independence are discussed. Finding the truth in psychological research is a challenge, and seemingly insurmountable difficulties are often encountered.

abstract = {Background: Improved knowledge based on clinical features of chronic pain in older adults would be valuable in terms of patient-orientated approaches and would provide support for health care systems in optimizing health care resources. This study identifies subgroups based on pain and psychological symptoms among Swedish older adults in the general population and compares derived subgroups with respect to socio-demographics, health aspects, and health care costs. Methods: This cross-sectional study uses data collected from four registers and one survey. The total sample comprised 2415 individuals ≥65 years old. A two-step cluster analysis was performed. Data on pain intensity, number of pain sites, anxiety, depression, and pain catastrophizing were used as classification variables. Differences in socio-demographics, quality of life, general health, insomnia, and health care costs among the clusters were investigated. Association of the clusters with the above parameters was further evaluated using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Four major clusters were identified: Subgroup 1 (n = 325; 15{\%}) - moderate pain and high psychological symptoms; Subgroup 2 (n = 516; 22{\%}) - high pain and moderate psychological symptoms; Subgroup 3 (n = 686; 30{\%}) - low pain and moderate psychological symptoms; and Subgroup 4 (n = 767; 33{\%}) - low pain and low psychological symptoms. Significant differences were found between the four clusters with regard to age, sex, educational level, family status, quality of life, general health, insomnia, and health care costs. The multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that Subgroups 1 and 2, compared to Subgroup 4, were significantly associated with decreased quality of life, decreased general health, and increased insomnia. Subgroup 3, compared to Subgroup 4, was associated with decreased general health and increased insomnia. In addition, compared to Subgroup 4, Subgroups 1 and 2 were significantly associated with higher health care costs. Conclusions: Two high risk clusters of older adults suffering from chronic pain; one mainly based on psychological symptoms and one mainly on pain intensity and pain spread, associated with decreased quality of life and health and increased health care costs were identified. Our findings indicate that subgroup-specific treatment will improve pain management and reduce health care costs.},

These latent variable applications go beyond the traditional latent variable useage in psychometrics with its focus on measurement error and hypothetical constructs measured by multiple indicators. The article argues for the value of integrating statistical and psychometric modeling ideas. Different applications are discussed in a unifying framework that brings together in one general model such different analysis types as factor models, growth curve models, multilevel models, latent class models and discrete-time survival models. Several possible combinations and extensions of these models are made clear due to the unifying framework.},

abstract = {For most individuals, perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns coexist to varying degrees. While there is agreement that within-person combinations of perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns produce meaningful ''subtypes'', the number and characterization of these within-person combinations is still debated. The two most prominent person-centered perfectionism models (the tripartite model and the 2 x 2 model) offer differing characterizations of how perfectionistic strivings effects perfec-tionistic concerns' relationship with psychological outcomes. According to the 2 x 2 model, perfectionistic strivings buffers against the negative effects of perfectionistic concerns. The 2 {\^{A}} 2 model thus claims the most deleterious within-person combination of perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns is low strivings and high concerns. In contrast, according to the tripartite model, perfectionistic strivings exacerbates the maladaptive effects of perfectionistic concerns. The tripartite model thus claims the most maladaptive within-person combination of perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns is high strivings and high concerns. The present study tested these competing claims in a group of English speaking Canadians and a group of Mandarin speaking Chinese. Results support the tripartite model of perfectionism.},

abstract = {Over a decade of research attests to the importance of resilience in the workplace for employee well-being and performance. Yet, surprisingly, there has been no attempt to synthesize the evidence for the efficacy of resilience training in this context. The purpose of this study, therefore is to provide a systematic review of work-based resilience training interventions. Our review identified 14 studies that investigated the impact of resilience training on personal resilience and four broad categories of dependent variables: (1) mental health and subjective well-being outcomes, (2) psychosocial outcomes, (3) physical/biological outcomes, and (4) performance outcomes. Findings indicated that resilience training can improve personal resilience and is a useful means of developing mental health and subjective well-being in employees. We also found that resilience training has a number of wider benefits that include enhanced psychosocial functioning and improved performance. Due to the lack of coherence in design and implementation, we cannot draw any firm conclusions about the most effective content and format of resilience training. Therefore, going forward, it is vital that future research uses comparative designs to assess the utility of different training regimes, explores whether some people might benefit more/less from resilience training, and demonstrates consistency in terms of how resilience is defined, conceptualized, developed, and assessed. Practitioner points: Despite conceptual and theoretical support for resilience training, the empirical evidence is tentative, with the exception of a large effect for mental health and subjective well-being outcomes. Most programmes utilize a cognitive-behavioural approach to developing resilience. At this stage, there is no definitive evidence for the most effective training content or format, but it would appear wise to include an element of one-to-one training and support based on individual needs.},

Design: An academic model designed by Pelletier, Seguin-Levesque, and Legault (2002) to predict teacher motivation and autonomy-supportive styles in academic settings, was adapted to the coaching context. Methods: The influence of pressure from above (sport administrations) and pressure from below (athlete motivation) on coach motivation and autonomy-supportive coaching behaviours was tested using structural equation modeling. Results: Results support the fit of the model in a sport context. Conclusions: Pressure from above, pressure from below, and coach motivation predict coaches' reported use of autonomy-supportive behaviours. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {People who have difficulty identifying and describing their emotions are more likely to seek out the experience of emotions in the high-risk domain. This is because the high-risk domain provides the experience of more easily identifiable emotions (e.g., fear). However, the continued search for intense emotion may lead such individuals to take further risks within this domain, which, in turn, would lead to a greater likelihood of experiencing accidents. Across three studies, we provide the first evidence in support of this view. In Study 1 (n = 762), alexithymia was associated with greater risk taking and a greater propensity to experience accidents and close calls. In Study 2 (n = 332) and Study 3 (n = 356), additional bootstrapped mediation models confirmed these relationships. The predictive role of alexithymia remained significant when controlling for sensation seeking (Study 1) and anhedonia (Study 2 and Study 3). We discuss the practical implications of the present model as they pertain to minimizing accidents and close calls in the high-risk domain.},

Teachers' years of experience showed nonlinear relationships with all three self-efficacy factors, increasing from early career to mid-career and then falling afterwards. Female teachers had greater workload stress, greater classroom stress from student behaviors, and lower classroom management self-efficacy. Teachers with greater workload stress had greater classroom management self-efficacy, whereas teachers with greater classroom stress had lower self-efficacy and lower job satisfaction. Those teaching young children (in elementary grades and kindergarten) had higher levels of self-efficacy for classroom management and student engagement. Lastly, teachers with greater classroom management self-efficacy or greater instructional strategies self-efficacy had greater job satisfaction. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Psychological Association.},

The research, which indicated the frequency and signi ‘peak experience' to skydivers, provided an insight into the nature of the skydiving  experience and the signi continued participation. The three sources of data relating to the skydiving experi-  ence provided a similarity across all respondents to such a degree that it was possible  to conclude that a ‘peak experience' was a common experience among veteran  skydivers.

abstract = {Background: Many alcohol research questions require methods that take a person-centered approach because the interest is in finding heterogeneous groups of individuals, such as those who are susceptible to alcohol dependence and those who are not. A person-centered focus also is useful with longitudinal data to represent heterogeneity in developmental trajectories. In alcohol, drug, and mental health research the recognition of heterogeneity has led to theories of multiple developmental pathways. Methods: This paper gives a brief overview of new methods that integrate variable- and person- centered analyses. Methods discussed include latent class analysis, latent transition analysis, latent class growth analysis, growth mixture modeling, and general growth mixture modeling. These methods are presented in a general latent variable modeling framework that expands traditional latent variable modeling by including not only continuous latent variables but also categorical latent variables. Results: Four examples that use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data are presented to illustrate latent class analysis, latent class growth analysis, growth mixture modeling, and general growth mixture modeling. Latent class analysis of antisocial behavior found four classes. Four heavy drinking trajectory classes were found. The relationship between the latent classes and background variables and consequences was studied. Conclusions: Person-centered and variable-centered analyses typically have been seen as different activities that use different types of models and software. This paper gives a brief overview of new methods that integrate variable- and person-centered analyses. The general framework makes it possible to combine these models and to study new models serving as a stimulus for asking research questions that have both person- and variable-centered aspects.},

The Short Grit Scale (Grit-S) retains the 2-factor structure of the original Grit Scale (Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, {\&} Kelly, 2007) with 4 fewer items and improved psychometric properties. We present evidence for the Grit-S's internal consistency, test-retest stability, consensual validity with informant-report versions, and predictive validity. Among adults, the Grit-S was associated with educational attainment and fewer career changes. Among adolescents, the Grit-S longitudinally predicted GPA and, inversely, hours watching television. Among cadets at the United States Military Academy, West Point, the Grit-S predicted retention. Among Scripps National Spelling Bee competitors, the Grit-S predicted final round attained, a relationship mediated by lifetime spelling practice.},

abstract = {To address calls for context-specific measurement of social support, this article reports the development of the Athletes' Received Support Questionnaire (ARSQ) and demonstrates initial evidence for its validity. Across four studies there was support for a four-dimensional structure reflecting emotional, esteem, informational, and tangible received support. There was also support for unidimensional and higher-order models. Further, Study 3 provided some support for convergent validity, with significant correlations between the corresponding dimensions of the ARSQ and the Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors. Study 4 provided evidence for the nomological validity of the ARSQ. Emotional and esteem support significantly predicted self-confidence and positive affect, and tangible support significantly moderated the relationship between stress and negative affect. Collectively, these results provide initial evidence for the validity of the ARSQ, and offer researchers flexibility to adopt either a multidimensional or aggregated approach to measuring received support.},

These differences are thought to underlie the personality dimensions of anxiety and impulsivity, and to have relevance for psychopathology. The present article aims at reviewing RST-based research on personality-psychopathology associations. First, RST and its revisions are described and the link between RST systems and personality dimensions is discussed. Second, studies investigating associations between RST systems and specific types of psychopathology are summarized. Although the available research yields a rather consistent picture with respect to constellations of BIS/BAS sensitivity that are associated with specific types of psychopathology, it also provides a clear indication that much work remains to be done.

abstract = {Avalanche professionals make dozens of decisions each time they step into the field. The best practices for decision-making in high-risk, dynamic environments are widely researched and discussed in the snow professional community. However, previous research in the leisure and outdoor recreation fields has failed to address the different ways in which male and female guides gather information and make decisions. This exploratory study sought to better understand the influence of an individual's gender identity on their decision-making and risk tolerance. A survey was administered to professional guides on Denali in the 2014 mountaineering season. Respondents answered questions pertaining to the factors that influenced their decision-making and risk tolerance, as well as their perceptions of those qualities in their coworkers. Results show that while there is no statistical difference between the personal risk tolerance levels of male and female Denali guides, but female backcountry partners are perceived to have a lower risk tolerance. This indicates the potential presence of a “gender heuristic trap”. $\backslash$n$\backslash$nMANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS$\backslash$nA better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of common decision making practices among avalanche professionals is crucial for improving their safety. Perceptions about male and female characteristics are problematic if they are not representative of actual behavior in the field. A better understanding of the decision-making practices of professional mountain guides also provide the foundation for the development of avalanche safety initiatives for recreational, non-professional backcountry users.},

abstract = {Overconfidence is used to explain various instances of detrimental decision making. In behavioral economic and finance models, it is usually captured by misperceiving the reliability of signals and results in overweighting private information. Empirical tests of these models often fail to find evidence for the predicted effects of overconfidence. These studies assume, however, that a specific type of overconfidence, i.e. " miscalibration," captures the underlying trait. We challenge this assumption and borrow the psychological methodology of single-cue probability learning to obtain a direct measure for misperceiving signal reliability. Our findings indicate that the perception of signal precision and measures of miscalibration are unrelated. We thus conclude that in order to test the theoretical predictions of the overconfidence literature in economics and finance, one cannot rely on the well-established miscalibration bias. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Risky behavior in humans is typically considered irrational, reckless, and maladaptive. Risk-sensitivity theory, however, suggests that risky behavior may be adaptive in some circumstances: decision-makers should prefer high-risk options in situations of high need, when lower risk options are unlikely to meet those needs. This pattern of decision-making has been well established in the non-human animal literature, but little research has been conducted on humans. We demonstrate in a two-part experimental study that young men and women (n=115) behave as predicted by risk-sensitivity theory, shifting from risk-aversion to risk-proneness in situations of high need. This shift occurred whether decisions were made from description or from experience, and was observed controlling for sex and individual differences in general risk-taking propensity. This study is the first ecologically-relevant demonstration of risk-sensitive decision-making in humans. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Previous research into the role of exercise motives (what people want from exercise) has overlooked the possible role of gains (what people get) and hence the possible benefits of motive fulfillment (when people get what they want). To redress this imbalance, we examined the additive and interactive effects of motives and subjective gains on exercise-specific outcomes. Young adults (N = 196) completed measures of exercise motives and gains, and exercise behavioral regulation, amount, satisfaction, and intention. Four representative motives/gains were selected: appearance, positive health, challenge, and affiliation. Path analysis was used to test the effects of motives, gains, and their products (the interactive effects) on behavioral regulations, and thereby exercise amount, satisfaction, and intention. Controlled regulation increased with appearance motive, unless appearance gain was high. Controlled regulation had a negative effect on exercise satisfaction. Autonomous regulation increased with positive health motive, provided positive health gain was high; with challenge motive and gain; and with affiliation motive. Autonomous regulation had positive effects on exercise amount, satisfaction, and intention. The study corroborates previous findings about the effects of motives. It establishes the value of also studying gains, as moderators of the effects of motives, and in their own right. The findings are interpretable in terms of self-determination theory. Exercise promotion could be more effective if it focused on gains in conjunction with motives.},

abstract = {Objectives: A novel analytical framework was used to re-examine and extend Cheng, Hardy and Markland's (2009) hierarchical model of anxiety. The modified model was characterized by six first order constructs, with worry, private self-focus and public self-focus representing cognitive anxiety, somatic tension and autonomous hyperactivity representing physiological anxiety and perceived control representing the regulatory dimension. It was hypothesized that these six first order constructs were formative indicators of the second order factors and this hypothesis was tested using Partial Least Squares analysis. Factor validity of the original hierarchical model proposed by Cheng et al. was investigated. Subsequently, items were refined, the hierarchical model extended, and factor and predictive validity investigated further. Method: Prospective data was collected from three samples (N = 174, 516, 43), and a series of factor analyses were conducted including Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Partial Least Squares modeling. Multivariate analysis examined the predictive validity of the model using a performance measure as the dependent variable. Results: The original model revealed a poor fit, with poor item loadings and discriminant validity. Subsequent analysis established a refined 25 item measure, which produced support for a fully differentiated hierarchical model of competitive anxiety. MANOVA revealed a significant effect for the control factor, with those achieving superior performance reporting significantly higher levels of perceived control. Conclusions: A fully differentiated hierarchical model was supported, which crucially depicts the first order factors of competitive anxiety that form the 3 s order dimensions. This provides a model that is a better fit with theory and provides a more refined diagnosis tool for applied sport psychologists.},

abstract = {Research demonstrates that facial appearance affects social perceptions. The current research investigates the reverse possibility: Can social perceptions influence facial appearance? We examine a social tag that is associated with us early in life—our given name. The hypothesis is that name stereotypes can be manifested in facial appearance, producing a face-name matching effect, whereby both a social perceiver and a computer are able to accurately match a person's name to his or her face. In 8 studies we demonstrate the existence of this effect, as participants examining an unfamiliar face accurately select the person's true name from a list of several names, significantly above chance level. We replicate the effect in 2 countries and find that it extends beyond the limits of socioeconomic cues. We also find the effect using a computer-based paradigm and 94,000 faces. In our exploration of the underlying mechanism, we show that existing name stereotypes produce the effect, as its occurrence is culture-dependent. A self-fulfilling prophecy seems to be at work, as initial evidence shows that facial appearance regions that are controlled by the individual (e.g., hairstyle) are sufficient to produce the effect, and socially using one's given name is necessary to generate the effect. Together, these studies suggest that facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look. In this way a social tag may influence one's facial appearance.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burnout affects nearly half of all U.S. nurses and physicians, and has been linked to poor out-comes such as worse patient safety. The most common measure of burnout is the well-validated Maslach Burn-out Inventory (MBI). However, the MBI is proprietary and carries licensing fees, posing challenges to routine or re-peated assessment. OBJECTIVE: To compare a non-proprietary, single-item burnout measure to a single item from the MBI Emotional Exhaustion (MBI:EE) subscale that has been validated as a standalone burnout measure. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of primary care providers (PCPs), registered nurses, clinical associates (e.g., li-censed practical nurses (LPNs), medical technicians), and administrative clerks in the Veterans Health Admin-istration surveyed in 2012. MAIN METHODS: We compared a validated one-item ver-sion of the MBI:EE and a non-proprietary single-item burnout measure used in the Physician Work Life Study. We calculated kappa statistics, sensitivity and specificity, positive predictive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), and area under the receiver operator curve (AUC). We conducted analyses stratified by occupation to deter-mine the stability of the correlation between the two measures. KEY RESULTS: We analyzed responses from 5,404 par-ticipants, including 1,769 providers and 1,380 registered nurses. The prevalence of burnout was 36.7 {\%} as mea-sured on the single MBI:EE item and 38.5 {\%} as measured on the non-proprietary single-item measure. Relative to the MBI:EE, the non-proprietary single-item measure had a correlation of 0.79, sensitivity of 83.2 {\%}, specificity of 87.4 {\%}, and AUC of 0.93 (se=0.004). Results were similar when stratified by respondent occupation. CONCLUSIONS: A non-proprietary single-item measure served as a reliable substitute for the MBI:EE across oc-cupations. Because it is non-proprietary and easy to in-terpret, it has logistical advantages over the one-item MBI.},

For the 90 women attending this psychology course, PS was associated with more frequent study behavior, evaluation of the course as more important, higher standards and expectations for academic performance, and better grades across the semester. Like PS, CM was associated with more frequent study behavior, but it was also related to perceptions of greater course difficulty, higher anxiety, and more negative mood prior to examinations. CM was not associated with better grades. The discrepancy between standards for performance on the midterm exam and actual midterm exam grades and attributions about these grades were also predictive of academic behaviors later in the semester and performance on the final examination.

abstract = {Growth curve modeling provides a general framework for analyzing longitudinal data from social, behavioral, and educational sciences. Bayesian methods have been used to estimate growth curve models, in which priors need to be specified for unknown parameters. For the covariance parameter matrix, the inverse Wishart prior is most commonly used due to its proper and conjugate properties. However, many researchers have pointed out that the inverse Wishart prior might not work as expected. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of the inverse Wishart prior and compare it with a class of separation-strategy priors on the parameter estimates of growth curve models. In this article, we illustrate the use of different types of priors with 2 real data analyses, and then conduct simulation studies to evaluate and compare these priors in estimating both linear and nonlinear growth curve models. For the linear model, the simulation study shows that both the inverse Wishart and the separation-strate...},

abstract = {Objective: The motivational processes underpinning walking behaviour are not well understood. This study aimed to develop walking-specific motivation measures drawn from self-determination theory (SDT), assess the psychometric properties of the measures, incorporating Baysesian structural equation modelling (BSEM), and examine how these variables relate to walking behaviour. Method: Participants (n = 298; mean age = 41.69; S.D. = 11.06; male = 57) completed the Behavioural Regulations in Walking Questionnaire (BRWQ), Psychological Needs Satisfaction for Walking Scale (PNSWS) and the IPAQ-long form, from which measures of workplace, transport and leisure walking were extracted. BSEM was used to test the hypothesized factor structures of the BRWQ and PNSWS. Internal reliabilities were assessed using the composite reliability coefficient. Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed by examining the relationships between the variables in relation to established theory. Results: BSEM showed excellent fit for the BRWQ and PNSWS measurement models. The scales demonstrated good internal consistency. The associations within and between the BRWQ and PNSWS subscales were generally as expected. The relationship between the BRWQ subscales and walking for transport and leisure were also generally as expected, but there were no significant relationships for walking at work. Two PNSWS subscales were significantly related to walking for leisure, but no significant relationships were evident for walking for transport and at work. Conclusions: There is preliminary evidence for the acceptable psychometric properties of instruments to measure SDT constructs in walking, and the findings highlight the advantages of BSEM. The findings also suggest that the motivational processes underpinning walking may vary by type of walking.},

abstract = {Sport may attract certain individuals; however, in this chapter we are more interested in the differences between individuals within the sport domain and how those differences might affect performance. Given that sports people are so different underscores the importance of considering the role of individual differences in performance. Unfortunately, sport psychology research has typically not accorded this level of attention to personality and individual differences. The purpose of this review is to underscore the importance of personality and to propose something of a paradigm shift for sport psychology researchers by giving personality a more central focus in the context of sport performance. We begin by providing a brief overview of personality conceptualization and measurement, as well as coverage of early personality research in sport including some of the limitations of that research. We then present more contemporary findings that address some of the problems associated with this early research. Although we touch on the "Big 5" personality traits , we do not cover this aspect of personality in great detail and interested readers are referred to Allen et al. for an excellent and detailed review of the Big 5 in relation to sport. Our review moves beyond these traits by focusing on two personality variables—narcissism and alexithymia—which are starting to receive increased research attention and have considerable potential applicability to sporting environments. Although we provide specific research directions at particular points in the chapter, we close with some broader research questions and challenges, as well as applied implications, for the role of personality in performance contexts. Purposefully, we concentrate our review at the level of the individual and thus the impact of personality on individual performance as opposed to the influence of personality in relation to team functioning and team performance.

abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Completed self-report questionnaires were received from 286 (72{\%}) survivors. CS-PTSDS were assessed with the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. Predictors of CS-PTSDS in a multivariate analysis were secondary sequelae factors of lack of social support (adjusted relative risk [RR], 2.90; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.37-6.13) and financial hardship in the aftermath of the trauma (adjusted RR, 2.47; 95{\%} CI, 1.16-5.26). In addition, the community factor of providing assistance in the aftermath of the avalanche (adjusted RR, 1.95; 95{\%} CI, 1.04-3.64) was inversely associated with CS-PTSDS. Screening for these factors may be useful in identifying those most vulnerable to developing chronic PTSD after this unique type of disaster.},

abstract = {An integrative model of the conative process, which has important ramifications for psychological need satisfaction and hence for individuals' well-being, is presented. The self-concordance of goals (i.e., their consistency with the person's developing interests and core values) plays a dual role in the model. First, those pursuing self-concordant goals put more sustained effort into achieving those goals and thus are more likely to attain them. Second, those who attain self-concordant goals reap greater well-being benefits from their attainment. Attainment-to-well-being effects are mediated by need satisfaction, i.e., daily activity-based experiences of autonomy, competence, and relatedness that accumulate during the period of striving. The model is shown to provide a satisfactory fit to 3 longitudinal data sets and to be independent of the effects of self-efficacy, implementation intentions, avoidance framing, and life skills. It is common for individuals to set goals but fail to follow through with them. It is equally common for individuals to attain their goals but to be no happier than before. Both of these out-comes, we suggest, involve failures in the conative process (Em-mons, 1989; Little, 1993): the motivational sequence that begins at goal inception, continues through the period in which goals are pursued and either attained or abandoned, and has important ram-ifications for individuals' happiness and further motivation. In this article we present an integrated model of the conative process. The model organizes a number of related research find-, show-ing that each previous article has provided information on one piece of, or subset of paths within, the proposed overarching model. The model pays particular attention to the self-concordance of individuals' goal-systems, that is, the degree to which stated goals express enduring interests and values. Three longitudinal studies are presented. Study 1 replicates and extends earlier find-ings, Study 2 provides support for important paths in the model not yet examined empirically, and Study 3 tests the entire model simultaneously while ruling out other important motivational vari-ables as causes of the self-concordance effects.},

abstract = {Objectives: Prescribing of homeopathy still occurs in a small minority of English general practices. We hypothesised that practices that prescribe any homeopathic preparations might differ in their prescribing of other drugs. Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Setting: English primary care. Participants: English general practices. Main outcome measures: We identified practices that made any homeopathy prescriptions over six months of data. We measured associations with four prescribing and two practice quality indicators using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Only 8.5{\%} of practices (644) prescribed homeopathy between December 2016 and May 2017. Practices in the worst-scoring quartile for a composite measure of prescribing quality ({\textgreater}51.4 mean percentile) were 2.1 times more likely to prescribe homeopathy than those in the best category ({\textless}40.3) (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.6–2.8). Aggregate savings from the subset of these measures where a cost saving could be calculated were also strongly associated (highest vs. lowest quartile multivariable odds ratio: 2.9, confidence interval: 2.1–4.1). Of practices spending the most on medicines identified as ‘low value' by NHS England, 12.8{\%} prescribed homeopathy, compared to 3.9{\%} for lowest spenders (multivariable odds ratio: 2.6, confidence interval: 1.9–3.6). Of practices in the worst category for aggregated price-per-unit cost savings, 12.7{\%} prescribed homeopathy, compared to 3.5{\%} in the best category (multivariable odds ratio: 2.7, confidence interval: 1.9–3.9). Practice quality outcomes framework scores and patient recommendation rates were not associated with prescribing homeopathy (odds ratio range: 0.9–1.2). Conclusions: Even infrequent homeopathy prescribing is strongly associated with poor performance on a range of prescribing quality measures, but not with overall patient recommendation or quality outcomes framework score. The association is unlikely to be a direct causal relationship, but may reflect underlying practice features, such as the extent of respect for evidence-based practice, or poorer stewardship of the prescribing budget.},

abstract = {Targeted communication about health behaviors seems to be more effective than mass communication in which undifferentiated audiences receive identical messages. Regulatory focus is psychological variable that can be used to build two target groups: promotion-focused or prevention-focused people. It is hypothesized that targeting messages to an individual's regulatory focus creates regulatory fit and is more successful to promote a physically active lifestyle than nonfit messages. Two different print messages promoting a physically active lifestyle derived from regulatory focus theory (promotion message vs. prevention message) were randomly assigned to N = 98 participants after measuring their regulatory focus. It was examined whether regulatory fit between the regulatory focus and the assigned print message would lead to more positive evaluations in the dependent variables inclination toward the message (preference for the message), intention to perform the behavior, prospective and retrospective feelings associated with the behavior (positive and negative), and perceived value of the behavior directly after reading the message. Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that regulatory fit led to stronger intentions in the prevention-message condition and more prospective positive and retrospective positive feelings associated with the behavior in the promotion-message condition in contrast to the nonfit conditions. Prospective positive feelings associated with the behavior mediated the effect of regulatory fit on intention. The results partly provided support for the regulatory fit concept. Matching print messages to the regulatory focus of individuals seems to be a useful approach to enhance physical activity motivation. Future studies should include an objective measure of physical activity behavior.},

abstract = {Major depression (MD) is a highly heterogeneous diagnostic category. Diverse symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, and fatigue are routinely added to an unweighted sum-score, and cutoffs are used to distinguish between depressed participants and healthy controls. Researchers then investigate outcome variables like MD risk factors, biomarkers, and treatment response in such samples. These practices presuppose that (1) depression is a discrete condition, and that (2) symptoms are interchangeable indicators of this latent disorder. Here I review these two assumptions, elucidate their historical roots, show how deeply engrained they are in psychological and psychiatric research, and document that they contrast with evidence. Depression is not a consistent syndrome with clearly demarcated boundaries, and depression symptoms are not interchangeable indicators of an underlying disorder. Current research practices lump individuals with very different problems into one category, which has contributed to the remarkably slow progress in key research domains such as the development of efficacious antidepressants or the identification of biomarkers for depression. The recently proposed network framework offers an alternative to the problematic assumptions. MD is not understood as a distinct condition, but as heterogeneous symptom cluster that substantially overlaps with other syndromes such as anxiety disorders. MD is not framed as an underlying disease with a number of equivalent indicators, but as a network of symptoms that have direct causal influence on each other: insomnia can cause fatigue which then triggers concentration and psychomotor problems. This approach offers new opportunities for constructing an empirically based classification system and has broad implications for future research.},

abstract = {Perfectionistic self-presentation is proposed as a deleterious interpersonal style that has an influence in clinical contexts that involves promoting a public image of perfection and avoiding displays and self-disclosures of imperfections. A sample of 90 clinical patients taking part in a clinical interview were assessed in terms of their levels of perfectionistic self-presentation and trait perfectionism and their affective, cognitive, and physiological reactions. Perfectionistic self-presentation dimensions were associated with (1) greater distress before and after the interview, (2) negative expectations and greater threat prior to the interview, and (3) post-interview dissatisfaction. Analyses of physiological data found that perfectionistic self-presentation was associated with higher levels of heart rate when discussing past mistakes, and, as expected, the need to avoid disclosing imperfections predicted higher levels of and greater change in heart rate when discussing past mistakes. Analyses that controlled for trait perfectionism and emotional distress showed that the need to avoid disclosing imperfections was a unique predictor of (1) appraisals of the interviewer as threatening before the interview and as dissatisfied after the interview; (2) negative pre and post self-evaluations of performance; and (3) greater change in heart rate when discussing mistakes.

Using R for Introductory Statistics fills this gap in the literature, making the software accessible to the introductory student. The author presents a self-contained treatment of statistical topics and the intricacies of the R software. The pacing is such that students are able to master data manipulation and exploration before diving into more advanced statistical concepts. The book treats exploratory data analysis with more attention than is typical, includes a chapter on simulation, and provides a unified approach to linear models. This text lays the foundation for further study and development in statistics using R. Appendices cover installation, graphical user interfaces, and teaching with R, as well as information on writing functions and producing graphics.

Within elite sport, multidisciplinary sport science and medicine teams play an important role in achieving an optimal balance between preventing athlete ill-health and optimizing health and performance. The psychological aspects of athlete health and performance have gained increased attention over the past two decades, with much of this research concerned with the mental health of athletes and the concept of mental toughness. Recently, it was proposed that mental health and mental toughness are contradictory concepts in the world of elite sport. Although an interesting proposition, this claim was not substantiated. Thus, the purpose of this narrative review was to evaluate theory and evidence regarding the thesis that mental health and mental toughness are contradictory concepts in the world of elite sport, with the view to advance scholarly knowledge and inform professional practice. Design Narrative review. Results A critical evaluation of this literature suggests that mental toughness may represent a positive indicator of mental health, or facilitate its attainment, rather than be at odds with it. Conclusion When implemented alongside multilayered approaches to organizational change (e.g., group structures, policies), mental toughness could be used as a ‘hook' to attract athletes into settings that can open dialogue on the importance of mental health and improve knowledge of key issues (e.g., stigma, symptoms).},

abstract = {This paper deals with an analysis of backcountry avalanche events in Austria. In particular the cumulation of accidents in certain periods will be investigated. During the last 50 years an average of 30 persons per year were killed by avalanches in Austria; about two third of all fatalities occurred as a result of `tourist avalanches´. The most fatal event in the backcountry was in January 1982 when 13 skiers (mainly students) were killed by an avalanche near toWerfenweng (Salzburg). The majority of `tourist avalanches´ occurs in a few (short) periods; generally one to four periods per winter can be identified. In many cases the cumulation of accidents is correlated with new snow and drift snow.},

abstract = {When modeling a probability distribution with a Bayesian network, we are faced with the problem of how to handle continuous variables. Most previous work has either solved the problem by discretizing, or assumed that the data are generated by a single Gaussian. In this paper we abandon the normality assumption and instead use statistical methods for nonparametric density estimation. For a naive Bayesian classifier, we present experimental results on a variety of natural and artificial domains, comparing two methods of density estimation: assuming normality and modeling each conditional distribution with a single Gaussian; and using nonparametric kernel density estimation. We observe large reductions in error on several natural and artificial data sets, which suggests that kernel estimation is a useful tool for learning Bayesian models.},

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a collection of symptoms first described by Pierre Janet—a colleague of Sigmund Freud, the forefather of psychoanalysis. He recorded the use of hypnosis with women believed to be displaying dissociative responses to emotional, sexual or physical abuse and trauma. Kardiner and Spiegel (1947) also report of hypnosis being used in the two world wars to help soldiers address combat related trauma. In WWI, it was called shell shock but was grossly under-diagnosed as many soldiers who were clearly suffering from PTSD were executed for ‘cowardice in the face of the enemy'. During the Second World War the label ‘combat fatigue' was attached and then after that ‘post-Vietnam syndrome'. The label PTSD was first used in 1980 when the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition (DSM-III), was published. PTSD is a condition that can occur after experiencing or witnessing traumatic events such as in military combat, during natural disasters or following serious accidents, terrorist attacks and violent deaths. It can also follow personal assaults such as rape and other situations in which the person felt extreme fear, horror or helplessness. Police, fire brigade or ambulance workers are more likely to have such experiences as they often have to deal with horrifying scenes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {(from the chapter) We begin by addressing how social psychology can be applied to real life, what methodological issues are involved in this endeavour, and how application can inform social psychological theories. We then describe the application of social psychology to three important topics: advertising, the workplace, and health. First, we discuss social psychological foundations of advertising. After reviewing some of the major theoretical models developed by advertising researchers, we argue that these models can be fruitfully subsumed under the more general dual-process approach to attitude change. To illustrate the usefulness of the dual-process process approach, we then discuss several advertising techniques in terms of dual-process theories of attitude change. Second, we apply social psychology to the workplace. We show how individuals form attitudes about their jobs, the organizations in which they work and the fairness of everyday work life. We discuss how to increase employee' job satisfaction levels, how to motivate them to be supportive towards their colleagues, an d how to increase their commitment towards the organizations. Finally, we turn to matters of health. We describe social psychology's important contributions to the prediction of health behavior and to brining about change of maladaptive behaviors, and the important role of social psychological factors in coping with stressors.

abstract = {Background: Few studies have prospectively examined risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the aftermath of a traumatic exposure. The aim of this study is to identify the concurrent influence of psychological and biological diatheses on PTSD onset and maintenance, taking into account socio-demographic factors and psychiatric antecedents. Methods: A total of 123 civilians (61.8{\%} of women) recruited in emergency units, were assessed using validated instruments during the first week and then at 1, 4, and 12 months post-trauma. Baseline assessment included evaluation of the psychological diathesis (i.e. psychiatric history and peritraumatic distress and dissociation), and the biological diathesis [i.e. cortisol, norepinephrine, epinephrine, c-reactive protein, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, glycosylated haemoglobin, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index, diastolic and systolic blood pressure (SBP), and heart rate]. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated both psychological and biological diatheses to be independent risk factors for PTSD. Peritraumatic distress and dissociation predicted onset (1-month) and mid-term PTSD (4-months), respectively. PTSD risk was associated positively with SBP and negatively with WHR, throughout the follow-up. In addition, a higher level of 12 h-overnight urinary norepinephrine independently predicted mid-term PTSD (4-months). Conclusions: This prospective study shows that peritraumatic psychological and biological markers are independent predictors of PTSD onset with specificities according to the stage of PTSD development; the psychological diathesis, i.e. peritraumatic distress and dissociation, being a better predictor of short-term dysfunction whereas biological diathesis was also predictive of development and maintenance of PTSD.},

The continuum has been used as a basis for using a relative autonomy index as a means to create motivational scores. Rasch analysis was used to verify the continuum structure of the Multidimensional Work Motivation Scale and of the Academic Motivation Scale. We discuss the concept of continuum against SDT's conceptualization of motivation and argue against the use of the relative autonomy index on the grounds that evidence for a continuum structure underlying the regulations is weak and because the index is statistically problematic. We suggest exploiting the full richness of SDT's multidimensional conceptualization of motivation through the use of alternative scoring methods when investigating motivational dynamics across life domains. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Psychological Association.},

@misc{Ramachandran1995,
abstract = {Patients with right parietal lesions often deny their paralysis (anosognosia), but do they have "tacit" knowledge of their paralysis? I devised three novel tests to explore this. First, the patients were given a choice between a bimanual task (e.g., tying shoe laces) vs a unimanual one (e.g., threading a bolt). They chose the former on 17 of 18 trials and, surprisingly, showed no frustration or learning despite repeated failed attempts. I conclude that they have no tacit knowledge of paralysis (or, if such knowledge exists, it is not available for this particular task). Second, I used a "virtual reality box" to convey the optical illusion to the patient that she was moving her paralyzed left hand up and down to the rhythm of a metronome, and yet she showed no sign of surprise. Third, I irrigated patient BM′s left ear canal with cold water, a procedure that is known to shift that patient′s spatial frame of reference by stimulating the vestibular system. Surprisingly, this allowed her "repressed" memory of paralysis to come to the surface; she said she had been paralyzed continuously for several days. I suggest that the vestibular stimulation produces these remarkable effects by mimicking REM sleep. These patients also emply a whole arsenal of grossly exaggerated Freudian "defense mechanisms" to account for their paralysis. To explain this, I propose that in normal individuals the left hemisphere ordinarily deals with small, local anomalies by trying to impose consistency but, when the anomaly exceeds threshold, an interaction with the right hemisphere forces a "paradigm shift". A failure of this process, in patients with right hemisphere damage, might partially account for anosognosia. Finally, I present a new conceptual framework that may help link several psychological and neurological phenomena such as Freudian defense mechanisms, vestibular stimulation, anosognosia, memory repression, visual illusions, anterograde amnesia, REM sleep, dreaming, and humor. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press.

abstract = {Background The Quality and Outcomes Framework,a financial incentive scheme for general practitioners in the UK, seems to have improved the quality of primary care and reduced inequalities in primary care delivery. It remains unclear, however, whether higher-quality primary care improves health outcomes or reduces health inequalities.Methods We conducteda cross-sectional study examining the association between quality of cardiovascular care and coronary heart disease(CHD) outcomes in 1531 general practices in London. We calculated CHDquality achievement scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for each practiceusing the 2006-2007 data from the Quality and Outcomes Framework.We used weighted linear regression models to assess the practice-level association between the CHD quality score and CHD admissions and deaths. Findings Overall,practices with higher CHD quality achievement scores had better CHD outcomes. Each one point increase in the CHD quality achievement score was associated with 4.28 (95{\%} CI 1.19 to7.38; p-0.007) fewer admissions per 100 000 for practices serving highly deprived populations and 2.11 (95{\%} CI 0.68 to 3.55; p-0.004) feweradmissions per 100 000 for practices serving populations of average deprivation. There was no association between the CHD qualityachievement score and the CHD admissions for practices serving affluentpopulations (p-0.906). We observed a similar deprivation-dependent gradient between quality achievement and CHD deaths. Interpretation High-quality primary care is associated with improved health outcomes. This association is strongest in deprived areas, suggesting that high-quality primary care may play an important role in reducing health inequalities.},

The events, listed by rank order of their mean life change values, comprised the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS). Ten years later, 42 of the 43 original events were rescaled. In this second study, an additional 44 events were added to the original list. In the present report, the original plus the later-developed events were scaled once again by persons chosen to closely approximate subjects enrolled in the initial study. Comparing the average life change intensity scores across 30 years, a 45{\%} increase in mean values was seen. These recently derived life change magnitudes, for both the original list of events plus the later-developed events, provide values appropriate for use in the 1990s. In the original study, effects of subjects' demographic characteristics were noted briefly in a table. In the present investigation, varying influences of gender, age, marital status, and education were explored in more detail. Several significant differences were discovered, with gender showing a very pronounced influence on scaling results. Discussion of these results included composition requirements for a life changes questionnaire.},

With 45 items, it is not overly lengthy, but there are situations where a short form is useful. Analyzing data from 4 samples, this article compares 2 frequently used 15-item short forms of the MPS—Cox et al.'s (2002) and Hewitt et al.'s (2008)—by examining to what degree their scores replicate the original version's correlations with various personality characteristics (e.g., traits, social goals, personal/interpersonal orientations). Regarding self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism, both short forms performed well. Regarding other-oriented perfectionism, however, Cox et al.'s short form (exclusively comprised of negatively worded items) performed less well than Hewitt et al.'s (which contains no negatively worded items). It is recommended that researchers use Hewitt et al.'s short form to assess other-oriented perfectionism rather than Cox et al.'s.},

abstract = {Psychological resilience is important in sport because athletes must constantly withstand a wide range of pressures to attain and sustain high performance. To advance psychologists' understanding of this area, there exists an urgent need to develop a sport-specific measure of resilience. The purpose of this article is to review psychometric issues in resilience research and to discuss the implications for sport psychology. Drawing on the wider general psychology literature to inform the discussion, the narra-tive is divided into three main sections relating to resilience and its assessment: adversity, positive adaptation, and protective factors. The first section reviews the different ways that adversity has been measured and considers the potential problems of using items with varying degrees of controllabil-ity and risk. The second section discusses the different approaches to assessing positive adaptation and examines the issue of circularity pervasive in resilience research. The final section explores the various issues related to the assessment of protective factors drawing directly from current measures of resilience in other psychology sub-disciplines. The commentary concludes with key recommen-dations for sport psychology researchers seeking to develop a measure of psychological resilience in athletes.},

abstract = {Background: OpenPrescribing is a freely accessible service that enables any user to view and analyze the National Health Service (NHS) primary care prescribing data at the level of individual practices. This tool is intended to improve the quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness of prescribing. Objective: We aimed to measure the impact of OpenPrescribing being viewed on subsequent prescribing. Methods: Having preregistered our protocol and code, we measured three different metrics of prescribing quality (mean percentile across 34 existing OpenPrescribing quality measures, available “price-per-unit” savings, and total “low-priority prescribing” spend) to see whether they changed after the viewing of Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and practice pages. We also measured whether practices whose data were viewed on OpenPrescribing differed in prescribing, prior to viewing, compared with those who were not. We used fixed-effects and between-effects linear panel regression to isolate change over time and differences between practices, respectively. We adjusted for the month of prescribing in the fixed-effects model to remove underlying trends in outcome measures. Results: We found a reduction in available price-per-unit savings for both practices and CCGs after their pages were viewed. The saving was greater at practice level (−{\pounds}40.42 per thousand patients per month; 95{\%} CI −54.04 to −26.81) than at CCG level (−{\pounds}14.70 per thousand patients per month; 95{\%} CI −25.56 to −3.84). We estimate a total saving since launch of {\pounds}243 thosand at practice level and {\pounds}1.47 million at CCG level between the feature launch and end of follow-up (August to November 2017) among practices viewed. If the observed savings from practices viewed were extrapolated to all practices, this would generate {\pounds}26.8 million in annual savings for the NHS, approximately 20{\%} of the total possible savings from this method. The other two measures were not different after CCGs or practices were viewed. Practices that were viewed had worse prescribing quality scores overall prior to viewing. Conclusions: We found a positive impact from the use of OpenPrescribing, specifically for the class of savings opportunities that can only be identified by using this tool. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to conduct a robust analysis of the impact of such a Web-based service on clinical practice.},

To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test-retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {In many big-data systems, large amounts of information are recorded and stored for analytics purposes. Often however, this vast amount of information does not offer additional benefits for optimal decision making, but may rather be complicating and too costly for collection, storage, and processing. For instance, tumor classification using high-throughput microarray data is challenging due to the presence of a large number of noisy features that do not contribute to the reduction of classification errors. For such problems, the general aim is to find a limited number of genes that highly differentiate among the classes. Thus in this paper, we address a specific class of machine learning, namely the problem of feature selection within support vector machine classification that deals with finding an accurate binary classifier that uses a minimal number of features. We introduce a new approach based on iteratively adjusting a bound on the l1-norm of the classifier vector in order to force the number of selected features to converge towards the desired maximum limit. We analyze two real-life classification problems with high dimensional features. The first case is the medical diagnosis of tumors based on microarray data where we present a generic approach for cancer classification based on gene expression. The second case deals with sentiment classification of on-line reviews from Amazon, Yelp, and IMDb. The results show that the proposed classification and feature selection approach is simple, computationally tractable, and achieves low error rates which are key for the construction of advanced decision-support systems.},

You can download the two-part article at www.snowpit.com. Several years ago, my buddy Steve died in an avalanche. It was a stormy day and the avalanche danger was high, but Steve and his partners felt that by choosing a familiar route and carefully managing their exposure, they could stay out of trouble. After all, they were experienced backcountry skiers with avalanche training. Steve, the most skilled of the group, had just visited the area less than a week before. Two hours into their tour, they met another party of skiers headed for the same pass and the low-angle slopes on the far side. They briefly discussed the avalanche conditions, and agreed that prudent route selection was the key to safety that day. But ten minutes later, as Steve's group broke trail across a shallow, treed slope, they triggered an avalanche that swept down on them from above. The avalanche caught all three skiers, seriously injuring one man and completely burying Steve. The other party witnessed the accident and came to the rescue, but by the time they dug Steve out, he was dead.},

abstract = {The purpose of my research is to determine the correlation between avalanche preparedness and avalanche fatalities in Utah's winter backcountry. I also want to raise avalanche awareness and help people realize the reality of the risks they take when venturing into the backcountry. For my research I studied avalanche fatality statistics in the state of Utah and in the United States as a whole. An increase in backcountry travel has lead to an increase in avalanche fatalities and a greater need for avalanche awareness. Slab avalanches are the most dangerous because they can sweep people off their feet and bury them very quickly. Unfortunately, backcountry recreationists and slab avalanches like the same slopes and snow conditions. People should be aware of the avalanche forecasts before they go out, and they should always have the basic avalanche equipment with them. Avalanche fatalities in Utah and the U.S. have been increasing since the mid 1990s, especially snowmobiler fatalities. The statistics also show that a male aged 21-30 years old is the high risk profile. Also, two thirds of those killed in avalanches are not using basic avalanche safety gear. To decrease the risk of avalanche fatality in Utah, young men between the ages of 16 and 30 need to be targeted for avalanche awareness programs. Part of the problem with current avalanches safety is the cost of avalanche classes and safety equipment. One thing that could be done is have more avalanche classes and seminars offered at high schools and state colleges for discounted prices.},

abstract = {Purpose The latent structure of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) has caused inconsistent results in the literature. The HADS is frequently analyzed via maxi-mum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis (ML-CFA). However, the overly restrictive assumption of exact zero cross-loadings and residual correlations in ML-CFA can lead to poor model fits and distorted factor structures. This study applied Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) to evaluate the latent structure of the HADS. Methods Three a priori models, the two-factor, three-factor, and bifactor models, were investigated in a Chinese community sample (N = 312) and clinical sample (N = 198) using ML-CFA and BSEM. BSEM specified approximate zero cross-loadings and residual correlations through the use of zero-mean, small-variance informative priors. The model comparison was based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Results Using ML-CFA, none of the three models pro-vided an adequate fit for either sample. The BSEM two-factor model with approximate zero cross-loadings and residual correlations fitted both samples well with the lowest BIC of the three models and displayed a simple and parsimonious factor-loading pattern. Conclusions The study demonstrated that the two-factor structure fitted the HADS well, suggesting its usefulness in assessing the symptoms of anxiety and depression in clinical practice. BSEM is a sophisticated and flexible statistical technique that better reflects substantive theories and locates the source of model misfit. Future use of BSEM is recom-mended to evaluate the latent structure of other psycholog-ical instruments.},

abstract = {While motivation to pursue goals is often assumed to be a trait-like characteristic, it is influenced by a variety of situational factors. In particular, recent experiences of success or failure, as well as cognitive responses to these outcomes, may shape subsequent willingness to expend effort for future rewards. To date, however, these effects have not been explicitly tested. In the present study, 131 healthy individuals received either failure or success feedback on a cognitive task. They were then instructed to either ruminate or distract themselves from their emotions. Finally, they completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task, a laboratory measure of reward motivation. Results indicate that participants who received failure feedback relied more strongly on the reward magnitude when choosing whether to exert greater effort to obtain larger rewards, though this effect only held under conditions of significant uncertainty about whether the effort would be rewarded. Further, participants with high levels of trait inhibition were less responsive to reward value and probability when choosing whether to expend greater effort, results that echo past studies of effort-based decision-making in psychological disorders.},

We examined the role of and interaction between the different perceptual-cognitive skills underlying anticipation and decision making. Skilled and less skilled players interacted as defenders with life-size film sequences of 11 versus 11 soccer situations. Participants were presented with task conditions in which the ball was located in the offensive or defensive half of the pitch (far vs. near conditions). Participants' eye movements and verbal reports of thinking were recorded across two experiments. Skilled players reported more accurate anticipation and decision making than less skilled players, with their superior performance being underpinned by differences in task-specific search behaviors and thought processes. The perceptual-cognitive skills underpinning superior anticipation and decision making were shown to differ in importance across the two task constraints. Findings have significant implications for those interested in capturing and enhancing perceptual-cognitive skill in sport and other domains.},

The purpose of the present investigation was to explore sport psychologists' experiences of building mental toughness and their perceptions of how coaches can build mental toughness in their athletes. A phenomenological approach to qualitative research guided the study. Semistructured qualitative interviews with 15 sport psychologists were conducted. A concept map was developed that illustrates the theme and subthemes that emerged from analysis of the interviews. As indicated, sport psychologists felt that coaches could build mental toughness in their athletes by behaving mindfully, which included putting athletes under adverse situations and providing (teaching) them with the mental skills to effectively cope with these adversities. These results both confirm and extend existing research on how to build mental toughness.},

The SISE and the RSE had nearly identical correlations with a wide range of criterion measures, including domain-specific self-evaluations, self-evaluative biases, social desirability, personality, psychological and physical health, peer ratings of group behavior, academic outcomes, and demographic variables. Study 4 showed that the SISE had only moderate convergent validity in a sample of children. Overall, the findings support the reliability and validity of the SISE and suggest it can provide a practical alternative to the RSE in adult samples.

Results showed dart accuracy performance correlated significantly with ego orientation when feedback was positive (win opponent), but not when negative (lose) or alterable (lose/win). Self-efficacy and perceived ability after task familiarity predicted performance in all feedback conditions. In Study 2, a computer-simulated running task was performed by participants under 3 feedback modes (win, lose, win/lose) nested within 2 conditions (self-standard and against an opponent). Results indicated that ego more than task orientation accounted for the performance variance in all experimental conditions. Self-efficacy and task-specific psychological states accounted for 63{\%} to 68{\%} of the performance variance. In Studies 3 and 4, exertion time in strength and endurance tasks were related to the type of activity in which participants were engaged and their commitment and exertion tolerance in the specific tasks. Goal orientation and self-efficacy accounted for much of the exertion-time variables' variance, but they were not significant predictors.},

abstract = {Background: Despite conflicting research findings and uncertain efficacy, single session debriefing is standard clinical practice after traumatic events. We aimed to assess the efficacy of this intervention in prevention of chronic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and other disorders after trauma. Methods: In a meta-analysis, we selected appropriate studies from databases (Medline Advanced, PsychINFO, and PubMed), the Journal of Traumatic Stress, and reference lists of articles and book chapters. Inclusion criteria were that single session debriefing had been done within 1 month after trauma, symptoms were assessed with widely accepted clinical outcome measures, and data from psychological assessments that had been done before (pretest data) and after (post-test data) interventions and were essential for calculation of effect sizes had been reported. We included seven studies in final analyses, in which there were five critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) interventions, three non-CISD interventions, and six no-intervention controls. Findings: Non-CISD interventions and no intervention improved symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, but CISD did not improve symptoms (weighted mean effect sizes 0.65 [95{\%} CI 0.14-1.16], 0.47 [0.28-0.66], and 0.13 [-0.29 to 0.55], respectively). CISD did not improve natural recovery from other trauma-related disorders (0.12 [-0.22 to 0.47]). Interpretation: CISD and non-CISD interventions do not improve natural recovery from psychological trauma.},

abstract = {This volume summarizes and organizes a growing body of research supporting the role of motivation in adaptive and rewarding interpersonal interactions with others. The field of human motivation is rapidly growing but most studies have focused on the effects of motivation on individuals' personal happiness and task engagement. Only recently have theorists and empiricists begun to recognize that dispositional and state motivations impact the ways individuals approach interpersonal interactions. In addition, researchers are now recognizing that the quality of interpersonal interactions influences consequent happiness and task engagement, thus helping to explain previous findings to this end. Similarly social psychology and relationships researchers have focused on the impact of cognitions, emotions, and behaviors on people's relationships. In their work, relationships researchers demonstrate that both contextual characteristics and individual differences influence the quality of interactions. Many of these studies seek to understand which characteristics strengthen the bonds between people, encourage empathy and trust and create a sense of well-being after a close interaction. This work seeks to integrate the field of human motivation and interpersonal relationships. Both fields have seen extensive growth in the past decade and each can contribute to the other. However, no single compiled work is available that targets both fields. This is the case, in part because only now is there enough work to make a strong and compelling case for their integration. In the previous years, research has been conducted to show that motivation is relevant and important for interactions among strangers and in close relationships. In addition developmental mechanisms for these relations are identified and mechanisms by which motivation strengthens people's relationships. Finally recent work has demonstrated the many implications for interpersonal relationships, showing that motivation impacts a range of interpersonal processes from prejudice regulation and objectification of others to empathy and care. This book seeks to summarize and organize all these findings and present them in a way that is relevant to both motivation researchers and social and relationship researchers.},

Witte's (1992, 1994) extended parallel process model (EPPM) explains many contradictory findings by pointing out the moderating role played by efficacy beliefs. Working from the EPPM, this article introduces the risk perception attitude (RPA) framework that categorizes individuals into one of four attitudinal groups: responsive (high risk, high efficacy), avoidance (high risk, low efficacy), proactive (low risk, high efficacy), and indifference (low risk, low efficacy). We conducted two studies to test our hypotheses that these groups differ in their self-protective motivation, intention to seek information, behavioral intention, knowledge acquisition, and time spent seeking information. Results, though not entirely consistent, suggest that, when risk and efficacy are made salient (Study 1), people's risk perception guides most of their subsequent actions, but in a natural context (Study 2), risk and efficacy jointly affect subsequent action.},

Thus, therapeutic options are urgently needed, and will be discussed in this review. Recent findings: Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process. Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses. Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators. For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed. Summary: For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.},

abstract = {This article begins with a brief survey of the recent update of the Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (DMGT). The DMGT defines talent development as the transformation of outstanding natural abilities (called gifts) into outstanding knowledge and skills (called talents). Two types of catalysts, intrapersonal and environmental, actively moderate the talent development process. The concept of motivation is situated at the core of the intrapersonal catalysts. Borrowing from action control theory, two goal management sets of processes are differentiated. The first set targets goal-identification (pre-decisional) activities, whereas the second set deals with goal-attainment (post-decisional) activities. They are labeled 'motivation' and 'volition' respectively. The article describes these two sets of processes, especially the distinction between goals and motives, as well as some practical impacts of individual differences in motivation and volition.

abstract = {Measurement invariance assesses the psychometric equivalence of a construct across groups or across time. Measurement noninvariance suggests that a construct has a different structure or meaning to different groups or on different measurement occasions in the same group, and so the construct cannot be meaningfully tested or construed across groups or across time. Hence, prior to testing mean differences across groups or measurement occasions (e.g., boys and girls, pretest and posttest), or differential relations of the construct across groups, it is essential to assess the invariance of the construct. Conventions and reporting on measurement invariance are still in flux, and researchers are often left with limited understanding and inconsistent advice. Measurement invariance is tested and established in different steps. This report surveys the state of measurement invariance testing and reporting, and details the results of a literature review of studies that tested invariance. Most tests of measurement invariance include configural, metric, and scalar steps; a residual invariance step is reported for fewer tests. Alternative fit indices (AFIs) are reported as model fit criteria for the vast majority of tests; $\chi$2 is reported as the single index in a minority of invariance tests. Reporting AFIs is associated with higher levels of achieved invariance. Partial invariance is reported for about one-third of tests. In general, sample size, number of groups compared, and model size are unrelated to the level of invariance achieved.

abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide socioeconomic unrest, forcing governments to introduce extreme measures to reduce its spread. Being able to accurately forecast when the outbreak will hit its peak would significantly diminish the impact of the disease, as it would allow governments to alter their policy accordingly and plan ahead for the preventive steps needed such as public health messaging, raising awareness of citizens and increasing the capacity of the health system. This study investigated the accuracy of a variety of time series modeling approaches for coronavirus outbreak detection in ten different countries with the highest number of confirmed cases as of 4 May 2020. For each of these countries, six different time series approaches were developed and compared using two publicly available datasets regarding the progression of the virus in each country and the population of each country, respectively. The results demonstrate that, given data produced using actual testing for a small portion of the population, machine learning time series methods can learn and scale to accurately estimate the percentage of the total population that will become affected in the future.},

abstract = {Background: Use of antipsychotics in elderly patients with dementia has decreased in the past decade due to safety regulations; however use is still high. Geographical variation may indicate discrepancies in clinical practice and lack of adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the management of behavioral symptoms. Objective: To investigate potential geographical variances in use of antipsychotic drugs in dementia care. Methods: A registry-based cross-sectional study in the entire elderly population of Denmark (≥65 years) conducted in 2012. Data included place of residence, prescriptions filled, and hospital discharge diagnoses. Antipsychotic drug use among elderly with (n=34,536) and without (n=931,203) a dementia diagnosis was compared across the five regions and 98 municipalities in Denmark, adjusted for age and sex. Results: In 2012, the national prevalence of antipsychotic drug use was 20.7{\%} for elderly patients with dementia, with a national incidence of 3.9{\%}. The prevalence ranged from 17.0{\%} to 23.3{\%} in the five regions and from 7.5{\%} to 33.1{\%} in the 98 municipalities, demonstrating an over four-fold difference. Conclusion: The observed geographical variation was more pronounced at municipal level as compared to regional level, suggesting that the variation may be related to variances in clinical practice in primary care. This study highlights an urgent need for further educating professional carers and physicians to guide non-pharmacological as well as pharmacological management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly patients with dementia.},

abstract = {This research ascertained the role of intrinsic, extrinsic, and amotivational styles as predictors of behavioral persistence in a real-life setting. At the beginning of the academic year, 1,042 first-term junior-college students enrolled in a compulsory college course completed a scale assessing intrinsic motivation, four styles of extrinsic motivation (namely, external regulation, introjection, identification, and integration), and amotivation toward academic activities. At the end of the semester, individuals who had dropped out of the course and those who had persisted were identified. Results showed that individuals who persisted in the course had reported at the beginning of the semester being more intrinsically motivated, more identified and integrated, and less a motivated toward academic activities than students who dropped out of the course. Gender differences also emerged. These revealed that females were more intrinsically motivated, integrated, and identified and less externally regulated and a motivated than male students. Females also displayed higher levels of behavioral persistence than males. Results are discussed in light of Deci and Ryan's (1985a) self-determination theory, and suggestions for future research are proposed.},

However, little is known beyond the obvious basics of what constitutes mental toughness in an English cricketer. This study addressed two main objectives: 1) develop a greater understanding of what mental toughness is within cricket, and 2) identify how existing mentally tough English cricketers developed their mental toughness. Twelve English cricketers identified as being among the mentally toughest during the previous 20 years were interviewed. Analysis of the focused interview transcripts identified the critical role of the player's environment in influencing ` Tough Character,' ` Tough Attitudes,' and ` Tough Thinking.' The global themes are presented in a mental toughness framework that has been used to disseminate the findings to the cricket coaching and playing population in England. The contrasting and complementary nature of the global themes are used to help provide a structural appreciation of the need for consistent interaction between environment, character, attitudes, and thinking in order that a performer can consistently be considered as mentally tough in cricket. Implications of the findings in relation to the delivery of sport psychology support within English cricket are also highlighted.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a new learning environments instrument designed to aid investigators and practitioners in measuring and researching the psychosocial learning environment in post-secondary distance education. Using a three-stage approach, the Distance Education Learning Environments Survey (DELES) was developed, field-tested with 680 distance education students, and then validated. The DELES has 34 items allocated to six scales: (1) Instructor Support; (2) Student Interaction and Collaboration; (3) Personal Relevance; (4) Authentic Learning; (5) Active Learning; and (6) Student Autonomy. An additional scale of Enjoyment was included in this study to explore associations between the psychosocial learning environment and student affective traits. Each learning environment item had a factor loading of at least 0.50 with its own scale, and less than 0.50 with all other scales. The alpha reliability coefficient for each scale ranged from 0.75 to 0.94. Simple correlations between Enjoyment and the DELES scales ranged from 0.12 to 0.31, with the scale of Personal Relevance having the strongest correlation with Enjoyment when all other scales were mutually controlled. The DELES, an online instrument that can be utilized by students at any location, eliminates data transfer errors and does not allow for non-responses, adding to the overall validity of the instrument. The development of DELES relied extensively on literature pertaining to high-quality distance education and expert content validation techniques. It treats distance learning as having a distinct social-psychological climate unlike those found in other post-secondary classroom environments.},

Because this process is data driven, it is inherently susceptible to capitalization on chance characteristics of the data, thus raising the question of whether model modifications generalize to other samples or to the population. This issue is discussed in detail and is explored empirically through sampling studies using 2 large sets of data. Results demonstrate that over repeated samples, model modifications may be very inconsistent and cross-validation results may behave erratically. These findings lead to skepticism about generalizability of models resulting from data-driven modifications of an initial model. The use of alternative a priori models is recommended as a preferred strategy.},

abstract = {Avalanche forecasting at the slope scale is an essential skill for traveling safely in avalanche terrain. Recent studies indicate that this skill is difficult for recreationists to master, and is subject to a number of persistent biases that can lead to avalanche accidents and their associated fatalities. In an effort to address this problem, researchers have developed a number of algorithmic, rule-based decision aids that simplify slope-scale avalanche prediction. Many of these decision aids are taught and used widely but to date, there has been no comprehensive comparison of their effectiveness. In this paper, we describe five of these decision aids (Reduction Method, Elementary Reduction Method, NivoTest, SnowCard, Obvious Clues Method) and analyze how they would have performed had they been used by accident parties in 751 historical US avalanche accidents. Using a principally nonparametric analysis, we found that these decision aids would have prevented between 60{\%} and 92{\%} of historical accidents, with the actual proportion of accidents prevented varying significantly among different decision aids. We also found that the preventive values of decision aids were statistically invariant to the level of training of the accident party, the type of recreational activity, and the type of slab avalanche released. In contrast, we found that preventive values differed significantly by snow climate, with four of the five decision aids being more conservative in maritime mountain ranges. All of the decision aids exhibited the highest preventive values during periods of considerable and high avalanche danger, but only one of them (the Obvious Clues Method) performed well during times of moderate and low danger. We also examined the mobility afforded by each method using a simple comparative metric based on slope angle, and found that two of the decision aids (NivoTest and Obvious Clues) allowed more latitude for travel in timbered areas adjacent to hazardous slopes. Using a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the effectiveness of the various decision aids across many virtual users, we found that a decision aid based on a simple checklist of obvious clues most frequently provided the optimal balance between accident prevention, mobility and ease-of-use. ?? 2006.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes. From the reviews: "...There are interesting and non-standard topics that are not usually included in a first course in measture-theoretic probability including Markov Chains and MCMC, the bootstrap, limit theorems for martingales and mixing sequences, Brownian motion and Markov processes. The material is well-suported with many end-of-chapter problems." D.L. McLeish for Short Book Reviews of the ISI, December 2006},

abstract = {Background and purpose: A recent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS) by Lane, Harwood, Terry, and Karageorghis [2004. Confirmatory factor analysis of the Test of Performance Strategies (TOPS) among adolescent athletes. Journal of Sports Sciences, 22, 803-812] provided only mixed support for structural integrity of the TOPS. The objectives of the present paper were to further examine the instrument's structural integrity and enhance it if necessary. Method and results: In a pilot study, a sample of North American athletes completed the TOPS. Results revealed poor fits during analysis of the competition and practice subscales. In Study 1, a number of new items were developed and a new competition subscale (distractibility) introduced, to address the problems identified and create the TOPS 2. CFAs of responses from a sample of Australian, North American and British athletes provided much stronger support for the factorial validity of the TOPS 2 inventory. However, the distractibility subscale suffered from poor factor loadings and reliability, and so was removed from further analysis. In Study 2, the factorial validity of the TOPS 2 was confirmed on a new sample of Australian athletes. Conclusions: The TOPS 2 appears to be an improvement over the TOPS. Implications of the results for practitioners are discussed, and future research directions are recommended. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Prior to attempting a novel task, subjects judged the level of performance they could achieve in relation to an anchor value representing a low, intermediate, or high outcome. Anchoring strongly affected initial self-efficacy judgments. Subjects then performed the task; success rates were controlled and equivalent in all conditions.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to propose and test a motivational model of high school dropout. The model posits that teachers, parents, and the school administration's behaviors toward students influence students' perceptions of competence and autonomy. The less autonomy supportive the social agents' behaviors are, the less positive are students' perceptions of competence and autonomy. In turn, the less positive students' perceptions are, the lower their levels of self-determined school motivation are. Finally, low levels of self-determined motivation lead students to develop intentions to drop out of high school, which are later implemented, leading to actual dropout behavior. This model was tested with high school students (N = 4,537) by means of a prospective design. Results from analyses of variance and a structural equation modeling analysis (with LISREL) were found to support the model for all participants and for each gender separately.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Such analyses can be conducted with observed variables (e. g., a typical regression approach) or latent variables (e. g., a structural equation modeling approach), and choosing between these methods can be a more complex and consequential decision than researchers often realize. The present article adds to the literature on mediation by examining the relative trade-off between accuracy and precision in latent versus observed variable modeling. Whereas past work has shown that latent variable models tend to produce more accurate estimates, we demonstrate that this increase in accuracy comes at the cost of increased standard errors and reduced power, and examine this relative trade-off both theoretically and empirically in a typical 3-variable mediation model across varying levels of effect size and reliability. We discuss implications for social psychologists seeking to uncover mediating variables and provide 3 practical recommendations for maximizing both accuracy and precision in mediation analyses.},

Data from 4,309 subjects show that associations between optimism and both depression and aspects of coping remain significant even when the effects of neuroticism, as well as the effects of trait anxiety, self-mastery, and self-esteem, are statistically controlled. Thus, the Life Orientation Test does appear to possess adequate predictive and discriminant validity. Examination of the scale on somewhat different grounds, however, does suggest that future applications can benefit from its revision. Thus, we also describe a minor modification to the Life Orientation Test, along with data bearing on the revised scale's psychometric properties.},

This paper describes the development and validation of the Single Item Narcissism Scale (SINS). Although the use of longer instruments is superior in most circumstances, we recommend the SINS in some circumstances (e.g. under serious time constraints, online studies). Methods: In 11 independent studies (total N = 2,250), we demonstrate the SINS' psychometric properties. Results: The SINS is significantly correlated with longer narcissism scales, but uncorrelated with self-esteem. It also has high test-retest reliability. We validate the SINS in a variety of samples (e.g., undergraduates, nationally representative adults), intrapersonal correlates (e.g., positive affect, depression), and interpersonal correlates (e.g., aggression, relationship quality, prosocial behavior). The SINS taps into the more fragile and less desirable components of narcissism. Significance: The SINS can be a useful tool for researchers, especially when it is important to measure narcissism with constraints preventing the use of longer measures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Konrath et al.},

To capture multiple facets of test anxiety, however, no multidimensional instrument with transcultural validity exits. In response, the current study reports on the cross-validation of an English version of the four-dimensional TAI-G, which had been introduced as an extended German adaptation of the TAI (Hodapp, 1991, 1996). First year university students of a multi-ethnic South African (N=102) and German sample (N=183) were given parallel versions of the TAI-G in English and German. Multigroup confirmatory factor models were conducted to examine structural and parametric invariance. Indicating high construct validity, a second-order model of test anxiety fits the data well for both samples. Associations with test anxiety correlates suggested high criterion validity. Scale structure and psychometric properties of the English TAI-G replicated findings of German samples suggesting transcultural applicability of the measure.},

abstract = {Corporate governance scholarship has shifted focus in recent years from hostile takeovers, which occur primarily in the widely held shareholder systems of the United States and the United Kingdom, to the comparative merits of the "controlling shareholder" systems that are the norm most everywhere else in the world. In this emerging debate, the simple dichotomy between controlling shareholder systems and widely held shareholder systems that has largely dominated the discourse is too coarse to allow a deeper understanding of the diversity of ownership structures in different national capital markets and their policy implications. In this Article, Professor Ronald Gilson seeks to complicate the prevailing analysis of controlling shareholders and corporate governance by developing a more nuanced taxonomy of controlling shareholder structures and examining the implications of this view on our understanding of widely held and controlling shareholder systems. Development of a new taxonomy begins with recognition of the controlling shareholder tradeoff: focused monitoring in return for some private benefits of control and at a cost in speed of adaptation. Building from this tradeoff, this Article looks closely at two central features of a more complex taxonomy: the concepts of controlling shareholders and of private benefits of control. In particular, the framework highlights the value of distinguishing between efficient and inefficient controlling shareholder systems, and between pecuniary and nonpecuniary private benefits of control. Together, the two distinctions reframe the taxonomy of shareholder distribution to distinguish between regimes that support companies with a diversity of shareholder distributions and regimes that support only companies with a controlling shareholder. This Article concludes by examining potential macroeconomic effects and policy implications and calling for research under this new framework to further the debate on controlling shareholder systems.},

abstract = {In their comparative review of H. J. Eysenck's arousal and J. A. Gray's reinforcement theories of personality, Matthews and Gilliland [(1999) Personality and Individual Differences, 26, 583-626] concluded that "Cognitive constructs may be more appropriate than biological ones for explaining the majority of behaviours, so that explanations of the kind offered by the Eysenck and Gray theories are relevant to a restricted range of phenomena only" (p. 620). In this commentary, I address a number of problems in Gray's account of the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behavioural Approach System (BAS) that need to be tackled before we can conclude that cognitive accounts of personality should supersede, rather than complement, biologically-based ones. I focus on two broad sets of issues. (1) Practical (operational) problems, that call for further experimental work, relating to: (a) BIS/BAS and conditioning/ learning; (b) reinforcement parameters (i.e., defining reward/punishment, reinforcement expectancies, schedules of reward, sources of reinforcement, cues versus feedback); and (c) psychometric measures of BIS/BAS functioning. (2) The theoretical nature of BIS/BAS effects, that call for an elaboration of Gray's theory. I propose a two-process model that postulates that the BIS and BAS exert two effects: facilitatory, the BIS mediates responses to aversive stimuli, the BAS to appetitive stimuli; and antagonistic, the BIS and BAS impair responses mediated by the alternate reinforcement system. Specific directions for future research are given. I conclude that, in several crucial respects, Gray's reinforcement theory has yet to be adequately tested; and that closer attention to operational definitions, and the mutual interplay of the BIS and BAS, may enhance its experimental precision. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The most important assumption when using the Likert scale is that the psychological distance between options is equal. The authors proposed a new algorithm for calculating the scale values of options by apply- ing item response theory and the ideas ofWakita to reveal the influence of the num- ber of categories. Three types of questionnaires that were composed of the same items, but used different numbers of options to assess these items (specifically, 4-, 5-, and 7-point scales), were completed by 722 undergraduate students. The results indi- cated that the number of options influenced the psychological distance between options, particularly for the 7-point scale. This influence was revealed only by the authors' algorithm; descriptive statistics and coefficients of reliability did not show that the number of options had a prominent influence.

These areas include text processing of internet documents, gene expression array analysis, and combinatorial chemistry. The objective of variable selection is three-fold: improving the prediction performance of the predictors, providing faster and more cost-effective predictors, and providing a better understanding of the underlying process that generated the data. The contributions of this special issue cover a wide range of aspects of such problems: providing a better definition of the objective function, feature construction, feature ranking, multivariate feature selection, efficient search methods, and feature validity assessment methods. {\textcopyright} 2003 Isabelle Guyon and Andre Elisseeff.},

abstract = {The authors draw on two families of theories – developmental networks and sociocultural perspectives on learning – to develop an interdisciplinary approach to the study of doctoral education as a path to the professoriate. This approach seeks to elucidate the connection between doctoral students' developmental networks, what they learn during their graduate experience (including their learning about the faculty role) and how they develop a professional identity. The authors first discuss the key tenets of the developmental networks and sociocultural perspectives, before exploring their alignments and explaining how the combination might remedy the limitations inherent in each approach. Finally, they offer some research propositions and directions for further study of the preparation of doctoral students for academic careers. For decades, the doctoral degree has been regarded as the route to an academic career. Although the numbers of individuals seeking doctoral degrees have increased in recent decades, and the degree is now viewed as preparation for a variety of careers in addition to university teaching and research, the PhD is still required for most academic posts (a notable exception is the for-profit higher education sector). While the purposes of doctoral education are widely debated, the need to better understand how doctoral programs shape teachers and researchers remains a key concern. Research shows that graduate programs do not always prepare students well for the realities they face once they earn faculty appointments (Austin 2002; Nyquist and Wulff 2003). In the United States, concerns about the effectiveness of doctoral programs in meeting students' needs spurred several high-profile initiatives aimed at improving graduate education, including the Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate (supported by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching), the PhD Completion Project (sponsored by the Council of Graduate Schools), and the Preparing Future Faculty Program (supported by the Council of Graduate Schools and the Association of American Colleges and Universities). In the UK, the Roberts Review (2002) similarly questioned the adequacy of train-ing of doctoral students for posts as university teachers. Huisman, de Weert, and Bartelse (2002) broadened the target, arguing that 'European countries must carefully scrutinize the pre-and early career stages of potential faculty members and make},

We then outline the role of personality in athletic interactions and group processes before considering the practical applications of personality research and avenues for future study. Our review shows that personality is an important determinant of long-term success in sport and identifies clear personality differences between individuals that participate in organised sport and individuals that do not participate in organised sport. We also observe important personality differences between sub-samples of athletes and outline the contribution of personality to intragroup relationships and team effectiveness in team sport. The interaction of genetic and environmental influences is presented as a promising avenue of inquiry that can strengthen our understanding of personality effects on sport and exercise participation and athletic success. We conclude by outlining implications for applied sport psychology. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Introduction: Self-determination theory has proven to be a useful theoretical explanation of the occurrence of ill-being on a variety of accounts. Self-determination theory may also provide a useful explanation of the occurrence of athlete burnout. To date, limited evidence exists to support links between motivation and burnout. Purpose: To examine relationships and potential causal directions among burnout and types of motivation differing in degree of self-determination. Method: Data were collected on burnout using the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire and Sport Motivation Scale from 392 top amateur male rugby players. Structural equation modeling procedures were employed to evaluate a measurement model and three conceptually grounded structural models. One conceptual model specified concomitant (noncausal) relationships between burnout and motivations varying in self-determination. The other conceptual models specified causal pathways between burnout and the three motivation variables considered in the investigation (i.e., intrinsic motivation, external regulation, and amotivation). Results: Within the models, amotivation, the least self-determined type of motivation, had a large positive association with burnout. Externally regulated motivation had trivial and nonsignificant relationships with burnout. Self-determined forms of motivation (i.e., intrinsic motivation) exhibited significant negative associations with burnout. Conclusions: Overall the results support the potential utility of a self-determination theory explanation of burnout. As all models displayed reasonable and comparable fits, further research is required to establish the nature (concomitant vs directional causal vs reciprocal causal) of the relationship between burnout and motivation.

Based on Gaussian multi-series innovations state space models, it relies on the log-ratio function to transform the observed shares (proportions) onto the real line. The models possess an unrestricted covariance matrix, but also have certain structural elements that are common to all series, which is proved to be both necessary and sufficient to ensure that the predictions of shares are invariant to the choice of base series. The framework includes a computationally efficient maximum likelihood approach to estimation, relying on exponential smoothing methods, which can be adapted to handle series that start late or finish early (new or withdrawn products). Simulated joint prediction distributions provide approximations to the required prediction distributions of individual shares and the associated quantities of interest. The approach is illustrated on US automobile market share data for the period 1961–2013.},

To discover the true nature of approach-avoidance motivation, psychologists need to move beyond this hedonic principle to the principles that underlie the different ways that it operates. One such principle is regulatory focus, which distinguishes self-regulation with a promotion focus (accomplishments and aspirations)from self-regulation with a prevention focus (safety and responsibilities). This principle is used to reconsider the fundamental nature of approach-avoidance, expectancy-value relations, and emotional and evaluative sensitivities. Both types of regulatory focus are applied to phenonomena that have been treated in terms of either promotion (e.g., well-being) or prevention (e.g., cognitive dissonance). Then, regulatory focus is distinguished from regulatory anticipation and regulatory reference, 2 other principles underlying the different ways that people approach pleasure and avoid pain.},

However, the relative error reduction in a combined forecast depends upon the extent to which the component forecasts contain unique/independent information. Unfortunately, obtaining independent predictions is difficult in many situations, as these forecasts may be based on similar statistical models and/or overlapping information. The current study addresses this problem by incorporating a measure of coherence into an analytic evaluation framework so that the degree of independence between sets of forecasts can be identified easily. The framework also decomposes the performance and coherence measures in order to illustrate the underlying aspects that are responsible for error reduction. The framework is demonstrated using UK retail prices index inflation forecasts for the period 1998–2014, and implications for forecast users are discussed.},

Multiple regressions showed that socially prescribed perfectionism negatively predicted exam performance when the overlap with self-oriented perfectionism was controlled for. In contrast, self-oriented perfectionism—a defining indicator of perfectionistic strivings—positively predicted exam performance. Moreover, task-approach goals mediated the positive relationship between self-oriented perfectionism and exam performance.

The principled missing data treatments that we discuss are couched in terms of how they improve causal and statistical inference in the prevention sciences.

Moderated hierarchical regression analysis revealed significant main and interaction effects of negative affectivity and escape self-awareness strategy in predicting risk-taking behaviors: high-risk sportsmen's negative affectivity leads them to adopt risk-taking behaviors only if they also use escape self-awareness strategy. Furthermore, the affective model remained significant when controlling for sensation seeking. The present study contributes to an in-depth understanding of risk taking in high-risk sport.},

These multidisciplinary experts provide insight into these difficult questions, and although each of the panelists had a slightly different definition of resilience, most of the proposed definitions included a concept of healthy, adaptive, or integrated positive functioning over the passage of time in the aftermath of adversity. The panelists agreed that resilience is a complex construct and it may be defined differently in the context of individuals, families, organizations, societies, and cultures. With regard to the determinants of resilience, there was a consensus that the empirical study of this construct needs to be approached from a multiple level of analysis perspective that includes genetic, epigenetic, developmental, demographic, cultural, economic, and social variables. The empirical study of determinates of resilience will inform efforts made at fostering resilience, with the recognition that resilience may be enhanced on numerous levels (e.g., individual, family, community, culture).},

Appropriate resilience-promoting strategies could potentially buffer or protect trauma-exposed individuals from psychopathology.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAIM: This study aimed to assess and compare (using validated measuring instruments) resilience, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other variables in the acute aftermath of rape, between adolescent and adult females and to assess associations with these variables.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHOD: We conducted a comparative analysis of resilience, PTSD, prior trauma, demographic variables and psychiatric morbidity in 41 adolescent and 47 adult female rape survivors six weeks post-rape. We assessed the relationship of resilience to PTSD, demographic variables and prior trauma and investigated if resilience levels predicted PTSD after adjusting for prior trauma.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We found no significant differences in resilience levels between the groups, but the adolescent PTSD rate (40{\%}) was double that in adults (20{\%}). In adults, a significant negative correlation was evident between resilience and PTSD symptoms scores.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: More knowledge of resilience versus stress susceptibility for PTSD throughout the lifespan is needed and can inform the development of more effective clinical assessment and resilience-promoting strategies.},

abstract = {Currently there are no brief, self-administered instruments for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80{\%} of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2{\%} of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4{\%} of men did so. Twice as many men (40{\%}) as women (21{\%}) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6{\%} of the student sample scored 32+ on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.},

We aim to describe time trends, variation and factors associated with prescribing gluten-free foods in England. Setting English primary care. Participants English general practices. Primary and secondary outcome measures We described long-term national trends in gluten-free prescribing, and practice and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) level monthly variation in the rate of gluten-free prescribing (per 1000 patients) over time. We used a mixed-effect Poisson regression model to determine factors associated with gluten-free prescribing rate. Results There were 1.3 million gluten-free prescriptions between July 2016 and June 2017, down from 1.8 million in 2012/2013, with a corresponding cost reduction from {\pounds}25.4 million to {\pounds}18.7 million. There was substantial variation in prescribing rates among practices (range 0 to 148 prescriptions per 1000 patients, IQR 7.3-31.8), driven in part by substantial variation at the CCG level, likely due to differences in prescribing policy. Practices in the most deprived quintile of deprivation score had a lower prescribing rate than those in the highest quintile (incidence rate ratio 0.89, 95{\%} CI 0.87 to 0.91). This is potentially a reflection of the lower rate of diagnosed coeliac disease in more deprived populations. Conclusion Gluten-free prescribing is in a state of flux, with substantial clinically unwarranted variation between practices and CCGs.},

In the present research the factor structure of Dispositional Resilience Scale (DRS; Bartone, Ursano, Wright, {\&} Ingraham, 1989), and its factorial invariance across gender was examined. Furthermore, the relationships of hardiness to five-factor personality traits and several mental health outcomes (positive affect, negative affect and physical symptoms) were also explored. Research was carried out on the sample of 597 employees from different companies. Five hypotheses about the structure of this scale were tested by using confirmatory factor analysis. The results mostly supported one-factor structure of abridged version of DRS (12 items), from which three negatively oriented items originally aimed at measuring challenge were excluded. Regarding measurement invariance across gender, the results of multi-group confirmatory factor analysis show that factor loadings are invariant across the samples of men and women, but error variances of items were not equivalent across samples. Furthermore, the results show that hardiness scales are in low to moderate correlations with five-factor personality traits, suggesting that they could not be subsumed under the five-factor personality traits. Hierarchical regression analyses show the incremental effect of abridged hardiness scale over five-factor personality traits in predicting mental health measures. Predictive strength of hardiness was the highest for positive affect, and considerably lower for negative affect and subjective physical symptoms.},

Until recently, research typically lacked a theoretical underpinning, and contemporary research is particularly informed by the psychobiological model of endurance performance. In this critical review, we propose that psychological theories relating to self-regulation, particularly self-efficacy theory and the process model of emotion regulation, could shed more light on how endurance performance is determined and lead to additional understanding of how psychological interventions can be used. We argue that people encounter fewer stressors in most experimental studies than are encountered before and during real-life events. In addition, we argue that most research conducted to date has focused on the forethought and performance phases of self-regulation, rather than the self-reflection phase, and research has not considered the cyclical nature of self-regulation. We also argue that if research participants are not endurance athletes, then their motivation may not be self-determined, and self-regulatory learning may not take place. Recommendations are given for future research, and evidence-based guidance is offered on enhancing performance and improving the quality of experience for endurance athletes.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Toward a new measure of intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and amotivation in sports: The sport motivation scale (SMS). Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 17, 35-53]) was developed to measure an athlete's motivation toward sport participation. However, the SMS does not measure the most autonomous form of extrinsic motivation, integrated regulation, which is inconsistent with self-determination theory (SDT; [Deci, E. L., {\&} Ryan, R. M. (1985). Intrinsic motivation and self-determination in human behaviour. New York: Plenum Press]) upon which the instrument is based. Moreover, several studies (e.g., [Martens, M. P., {\&} Webber, S. N. (2002). Psychometric properties of the sport motivation scale: An evaluation with college varsity athletes from the U.S. Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 24, 254-270]) have questioned the factorial validity of the SMS. Hence, the purpose of this study was to develop a revised version of the SMS, including integrated regulation. Method: In Stage 1, the factorial validity of the SMS was examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on data collected from 614 Australians (elite athletes and university students). In Stage 2, the scale was revised by including integrated regulation items and replacing problematic items through an iterative process using CFA for data collected from 557 Australian university students. Concurrent validity of the revised scale was examined by evaluating correlations with the dispositional flow scale-2 (DFS-2) [Jackson, S. A., {\&} Eklund, R. C. (2004). The flow scales manual. Morgantown, WV: Fitness Information Technology]. Results: The revision led to development of a six-factor 24-item scale (SMS-6) that indicated a more parsimonious and improved fitting model consistent with SDT. Correlations between the SMS-6 and DFS-2 factors support the concurrent validity of the revised scale. Conclusion: From statistical and theoretical viewpoints, the revised SMS-6 was preferable to the original SMS, except for the discriminant validity issue of identification regulation. Further examination of the instrument is necessary by cross-validating the findings from this study. ?? 2007.},

abstract = {Mixture modeling is a widely applied data analysis technique used to identify unobserved heterogeneity in a population. Despite mixture models' usefulness in practice, one unresolved issue in the application of mixture models is that there is not one commonly accepted statistical indicator for deciding on the number of classes in a study population. This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the performance of likelihood-based tests and the traditionally used Information Criterion (ICs) used for determining the number of classes in mixture modeling. We look at the performance of these tests and indexes for 3 types of mixture models: latent class analysis (LCA), a factor mixture model (FMA), and a growth mixture models (GMM). We evaluate the ability of the tests and indexes to correctly identify the number of classes at three different sample sizes (n = 200, 500, 1,000).

abstract = {Missing data are unavoidable in epidemiological and clinical research but their potential to undermine the validity of research results has often been overlooked in the medical literature (1). This is partly because statistical methods that can tackle problems arising from missing data have, until recently, not been readily accessible to medical researchers. However, multiple imputationa relatively flexible, general purpose approach to dealing with missing datais now available in standard statistical software,(2,5) making it possible to handle missing data semiroutinely. Results based on this computationally intensive method are increasingly reported, but it needs to be applied carefully to avoid misleading conclusions. In this article, we review the reasons why missing data may lead to bias and loss of information in epidemiological and clinical research. We discuss the circumstances in which multiple imputation may help by reducing bias or increasing precision, as well as describing potential pitfalls in its application. Finally, we describe the recent use and reporting of analyses using multiple imputation in general medical journals, and suggest guidelines for the conduct and reporting of such analyses.},

abstract = {Is there increasing cognitive partitioning by occupation over time? Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve strongly suggests such a trend. Herrnstein and Murray specify 12 occupations as “high-IQ professions.” They argue that as jobs in these occupations increase over time, more people with high IQs are drawn to these occupations. Thus, there is a growing concentration of the cognitive elite in high-IQ occupations and increasing cognitive partitioning by occupation. However, I find Herrnstein and Murray's analysis problematic due to lack of evidence and misinterpretation of data. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Survey, I rank occupations by incumbents' mean IQ and demonstrate that Herrnstein and Murray overestimate the rankings of some high-IQ occupations, the mean IQ level of persons in high-IQ occupations, and the percentage of high-IQ persons engaged in high-IQ occupations. In addition, using data from the General Social Survey, 1974–1998, I find no evidence that cognitive partitioning by occupation has increased over time.

@article{Sanli2013,
abstract = {The purpose of the present review was to provide a theoretical understanding of the learning advantages underlying a self-controlled practice context through the tenets of the self-determination theory (SDT). Three micro-theories within the macro-theory of SDT (Basic psychological needs theory, Cognitive EvaluationTheory, and Organismic Integration Theory) are used as a framework for examining the current self-controlled motor learning literature. A review of 26 peer-reviewed, empirical studies from the motor learning and medical training literature revealed an important limitation of the self-controlled research in motor learning: that the effects of motivation have been assumed rather than quantified. The SDT offers a basis from which to include measurements of motivation into explana-tions of changes in behavior. This review suggests that a self-controlled practice context can facilitate such factors as feelings of autonomy and competence of the learner, thereby supporting the psychological needs of the learner, leading to long term changes to behav-ior. Possible tools for the measurement of motivation and regulation in future studies are discussed. The SDT not only allows for a theoretical reinterpretation of the extant motor learning research supporting self-control as a learning variable, but also can help to better understand and measure the changes occurring between the practice environment and the observed behavioral outcomes.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding the factors that influence physical activity can aid the design of more effective interventions. Previous reviews of correlates of youth physical activity have produced conflicting results. Methods: A comprehensive review of correlates of physical activity was conducted, and semiquantitative results were summarized separately for children (ages 3–12) and adolescents (ages 13–18). The 108 studies evaluated 40 variables for children and 48 variables for adolescents. Results: About 60{\%} of all reported associations with physical activity were statistically significant. Variables that were consistently associated with children's physical activity were sex (male), parental overweight status, physical activity preferences, intention to be active, perceived barriers (inverse), previous physical activity, healthy diet, program/facility access, and time spent outdoors. Variables that were consistently associated with adolescents' physical activity were sex (male), ethnicity (white), age (inverse), perceived activity competence, intentions, depression (inverse), previous physical activity, community sports, sensation seeking, sedentary after school and on weekends (inverse), parent support, support from others, sibling physical activity, direct help from parents, and opportunities to exercise. Conclusion: These consistently related variables should be confirmed in prospective studies, and interventions to improve the modifiable variables should be developed and evaluated. Key},

In Project 1, external, introjected, identified, and intrinsic types of reasons for achievement-related behaviors are shown to conform to a simplex-like (ordered correlation) structure in four samples. These reason categories are then related to existing measures of PLOC and to motivation. A second project examines 3 reason categories (external, introject, and identification) within the domain of prosocial behavior. Relations with measures of empathy, moral judgment, and positive interpersonal relatedness are presented. Finally, the proposed model and conceptualization of PLOC are discussed with regard to intrapersonal versus interpersonal perception, internalization, cause-reason distinctions, and the significance of perceived autonomy in human behavior.},

A practical approach to guide the search or the selection process is to compute cross-validation performance estimates of the different variable subsets.

Therefore, they cannot be used reliably to compare two selection methods, as is shown by the empirical results of this paper. Instead, like in other instances of the model selection problem, independent test sets should be used for determining the final performance.

In this paper, we propose that self-sabotaging behaviours, including overcommitting, procrastination and perfectionism, have a role to play. At Flinders University, we have developed a program in which we work with PhD students to help to reduce these behaviours and give them the strategies and attitudes they need to successfully (and happily!) complete their thesis. The program utilises cognitive–behavioural coaching, an evidence-based strategy that we claim leads to significant and long-term behavioural change. An evaluation of the program indicates that it is very successful, improving students' ability to manage their time, set specific times for writing, and show work to their supervisor regularly, and that these behaviours were associated with lower levels of stress and improved ability to complete.

abstract = {Heli-ski guiding can be considered as a prime example of high-stress, high-consequence decision making in avalanche terrain. A combination of factors make heli-skiing an exciting consumer experience but also results in a high-pressure scenario that demands consistently high quality decisions by guides and operators to mitigate avalanche risk. A key mitigation tool used by heli-ski guides to avoid avalanches is careful selection of terrain to optimally meet client and safety demands. Therefore, heli-ski operations provide a unique setting to examine the terrain preferences of highly experienced professionals as they balance terrain, changing avalanche hazard, group expertize and, a variety of other factors.Previous work examining heli-ski operations and avalanche hazard have considered case-studies of accidents, or close calls. However, no analysis has been undertaken to examine real-time, terrain-focused selection choices, as evidenced by the resulting ski tracks as taken by the guides. Our work is presented as an exploration, and presents the results of GPS tracks analyzed for 18 days of heli-ski guiding at Majestic Heli-Ski in Alaska. Given the limited size of our data set statistical robustness is limited.Using handheld GPS devices we obtained a record of terrain used by lead guides under varying snow, avalanche and group conditions. The tracks are then analyzed within a GIS to extract key terrain metrics including slope, elevation and aspect. When these data are grouped by day, avalanche conditions, or group, there are limited differences in terrain attributes, which can be attributed to the simple terrain metrics used and also the ability of a heli-ski guide to move to more favorable areas under varying conditions to maintain desired slope angles. However, when we consider tracks in terrain which is reused under different conditions, there is a statistically significant difference in terrain usage which is attributed to avalanche hazard conditions. Management implications: (filled circle)The management implications of our work are that we present a tangible and practical method for the documentation and quantification of different heli-ski guides' terrain preferences under varying conditions.(filled circle)These methods provide a potential tool for the effective transfer of institutional knowledge from one guide to another within the operation.(filled circle)Furthermore, with careful consideration to key metrics used, this method also presents a potential opportunity for internal and, or external auditing by the operations themselves, or outside third parties (e.g. Alaska Occupational Safety and Health).(filled circle)Given the recent fatalities in the industry in Alaska, and proposed new checks by the Alaska Occupational Safety and Health agency, there is a strong desire to better understand, and quantify practices in this industry. One way to accomplish this is by observing terrain preferences by guides on a day to day basis.(filled circle)Finally, if our methods were applied in near-real time, they have the potential for real-time operational self-checking and management of terrain use by an operation on-the-fly, thereby aiding decision making with respect to terrain use, and maintaining institutional overview on all terrain decisions made.},

In contrast, little is known about the effectiveness of predeployment training in preventing or mitigating the impact of combat-related stressors on the development of PTSD. We conducted a comprehensive review of literature pertaining to primary prevention efforts to stem the advent of PTSD and other combat and operational stress injuries in military populations using databases from the peer-reviewed literature as well as online searches and colleague referrals. Results show that, as with treatment for PTSD, the most promising preventive approaches appear to utilize exposure strategies, especially those in conjunction with education and stress reduction skills training.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the existence and the importance of the distinction between self-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism in the Eating Disorder Inventory Perfectionism subscale (EDI-P). METHOD: Trait perfectionism, measured by the EDI-P, and eating disorder symptoms, measured by the 26-item Eating Attitudes Test, were examined in 220 university students (110 women and 110 men) belonging to a campus-based fitness facility. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that, for both genders, the EDI-P is best represented by a multidimensional factor structure with three self-oriented perfectionism items (EDI-SOP) and three socially prescribed perfectionism items (EDI-SPP). Structural equation modeling demonstrated that, for both genders, EDI-SOP and EDI-SPP are related independently to eating disorder symptoms. Moderational analysis indicated that, for women, the impact of EDI-SOP on eating disorder symptoms is dependent on the level of EDI-SPP. DISCUSSION: It is suggested that future research should acknowledge the empirical and theoretical implications of having EDI-SOP and EDI-SPP in the EDI-P. It is cautioned that EDI-SOP and EDI-SPP are a partial representation of an already published multidimensional model of trait perfectionism.},

In this Festschrift, I trace the theoretical development of Gray's approach—now known as Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST)—out of the Eysenckian tradition to its most recent articulation. Experimental attempts to test RST are reviewed and the theoretical problems raised by this literature discussed. Also presented are data relating to a recent clarification of RST, viz. the joint subsystems hypothesis, which postulates a fundamental interdependence of appetitive and aversive systems in the typical human laboratory. The value of Gray's general approach to building behavioural theories on the bases of both the conceptual nervous system and the real nervous system is validated in personality, which has long been thought a philosophical mystery rather than a standard problem to be tackled by scientific method. q},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The purpose of this paper is to determine the phenotypic relationships, and etiologic underpinnings, of cognitive/ psychological traits with psychiatric resilience. Resilience was defined as the difference between the twins' total score on a broad measure of internalizing symptoms and their predicted score based on their cumulative exposure to stressful life events (SLEs). Cholesky decompositions were performed in a large twin sample (n = 7500 individuals) to quantify the overlap in genetic and environmental factors between resilience and six traits (neuroticism, optimism, self-esteem, mastery, interpersonal dependency, altruism) in bivariate analyses, and in a multivariate model. On a phenotypic level, each trait accounted for variance in resilience in univariate analyses. In the multivariate regression neuroticism accounted for the majority of the variance and attenuated the relation-ships between the other traits and resilience. The genetic factors that influence the traits account for between 7 and 60{\%} of the heritability of resilience. In the multivariate genetic model neuroticism accounted for all of the genetic covariance between the traits and resilience; 40{\%} of the genetic influence on resilience was indepen-dent. Neuroticism evidenced the largest phenotypic and genetic relationship with resilience, and accounted for nearly all of the phenotypic and genetic variance between resilience and the other traits.},

abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develope an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects echibit several pervasice effects that are iconsistent with the basic tenet of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendencym called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilites are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilites, except in the range of low probabilites. Overweighting of low probablities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling},

The number of MR call- outs has increased, partly because teams are increasingly being used by the police in searches for missing people in non-mountainous areas. Most MR teams feel they are coping with the increased demand although some are becoming selective about which call-outs they respond to. A survey of MR team members and potential recruits reveals a mismatch between potential members' expectation of being engaged in MR and the reality of the increased work supporting non-mountain incidents. This illustrates a potential strain in the motivations of volunteers being used to deliver public services. This article explores how this is particular to the type of volunteering involved in Copyright The Policy Press MR, how teams have coped with the increased demand and how the increased use of MR teams is partly a response to changed police management practices.},

In this study three well-known classifiers were employed for the classification task: C4.5, naive-Bayes and IB1.

To address this research need, in-depth interviews were employed in order to identify the factors that underpin the motivational climate created by peers in youth sport. Methods: Individually and in small focus groups, 14 boys and 16 girls (N=30), aged between 12 and 16 years old from both individual and team sports, were interviewed regarding peer-induced characteristics of their motivational climates. Results: Using content analyses, the following 11 dimensions of peer climate emerged: Cooperation, effort, improvement, mistakes, intra-team competition, intra-team conflict, equal treatment, normative ability, autonomy support, evaluation of competence and relatedness support. Conclusions: Some of the resulting dimensions are similar to the factors included in existing instruments assessing adult (i.e. PE teacher or coach-created) motivational climates. However, some facets of the climate unique to peer groups were also identified in this study. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed and suggestions for future research on the peer motivational climate are provided. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It has helped to simplify the often complex and difficult task of choosing and using the right statistics package.This is a book for any student or professional biologist who wants to process data using a statistical package on the computer, to select appropriate methods, and extract the important information from the often confusing output that is produced. It is aimed primarily at undergraduates and masters students in the biological sciences who have to apply statistics in practical classes and projects. Such users of statistics do not have to understand either how tests work or how to do the calculations, and these aspects are not covered in the book.The new edition has been updated to cover the very latest versions of the computer packages described, expanded to include coverage for logistic regression, a more detailed consideration of multivariate analysis, data exploration and further examples of Principle Component Analysis and Discriminate Function Analysis are given. New edition will use SPSS 10.0, Minitab 13.1 and Excel 2000. New simplified version of the Key and flow chart of decisions to reach simple statistical tests. Section on multivariate techniques expanded to give further examples of PCA and DFA. Aimed at students using statistics for projects and in practical classes. Statistical jargon explained through an extensive glossary and key to symbols. Stresses the importance of experimental design, measurement of data and interpretation of results rather than an understanding of the statistical tests themselves.},

SLR is implemented through a uniform depth increase across the model domain, with a comparison between the implementation of coastal defences or allowing low-lying land to flood. The complex spatial response of the semi-diurnal M{\textless}span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"{\textgreater}2{\textless}/span{\textgreater} constituent does not appear to be linear with the imposed SLR. The most predominant features of this response are the generation of new amphidromic systems within the Gulf of Carpentaria and large-amplitude changes in the Arafura Sea, to the north of Australia, and within embayments along Australia's north-west coast. Dissipation from M{\textless}span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"{\textgreater}2{\textless}/span{\textgreater} notably decreases along north-west Australia but is enhanced around New Zealand and the island chains to the north. The diurnal constituent, K{\textless}span classCombining double low line"inline-formula"{\textgreater}1{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, is found to decrease in amplitude in the Gulf of Carpentaria when flooding is allowed. Coastal flooding has a profound impact on the response of tidal amplitudes to SLR by creating local regions of increased tidal dissipation and altering the coastal topography. Our results also highlight the necessity for regional models to use correct open boundary conditions reflecting the global tidal changes in response to SLR.},

Disability, self-efficacy and goal importance were each assessed before and at 3 and 9 months after participants underwent joint replacement surgery. Results. Disability had decreased at 3 and 9 months post-surgery assessments. Self-efficacy beliefs were higher at 3 and 9 months following surgery while goal importance was increased at 9 months but not at 3 months. Medical variables and prior disability predicted disability at 3 months. Social-cognitive variables did not contribute to the prediction of 3 months disability. Pre-surgery goal importance and self-efficacy at 3 months were independent predictors of disability at 9 months after controlling for pre-surgery and 3 months disability. Evidence also suggested that goal importance and self-efficacy interacted to predict levels of disability at 9 months following surgery. Conclusions. The findings demonstrate that recovery is governed not solely by medical phenomena but also by psychological variables and suggest that modification of these variables may have an impact on recovery outcomes. Moreover, attention should be paid to the timing of such intervention and to the length of follow-up.},

Previous research by Poag-DuCharme and Brawley (1993, 1994) and suggestions by Bandura (1989, 1997) led to the hypothesis that goals would influence exercise behavior through the mediating variable of self-efficacy. Changes to the social cognitions and behavioral patterns of adherers during the exercise program were also assessed. Results demonstrate that at midprogram, self-efficacy beliefs mediated the relationship between goal influence and exercise frequency. Significant increases were observed in self-efficacy and perceived exertion from onset to midprogram. Onset goal influence and self-efficacy significantly discriminated adherers from dropouts. Results are discussed with respect to the need to continue investigating the changing influence of social cognitions on motivating behavior.},

Following single-factor confirmatory factor analyses and item deletion, a 12-item version was subject to correlated traits / correlated uniqueness (CTCU) analysis. An acceptable fit was revealed. Study 2 used a different sample of 355 athletes. The CTCU analysis confirmed the factorial validity of the 12-item VMIQ-2. In Study 3, the concurrent and construct validity of the VMIQ-2 was supported. Taken together, the results of the 3 studies provide preliminary support for the revised VMIQ-2 as a psychometrically valid questionnaire. {\textcopyright} 2008 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract = {The authors examined ought, ideal, and feared self-discrepancies as predictors of agitation-and dejection-related affects. Overall, discrepancy from feared selves predicted anxiety and guilt, preempting the role of discrepancies from ought selves; ideal and feared discrepancies both predicted depression. Further analyses revealed interactions between actual-ought and actual-feared discrepancies in predicting anxiety and guilt. Among participants who were relatively near their feared selves, discrepancies from ought selves were unrelated to these affects. In contrast, among those whose feared selves were more distant, ought discrepancies did predict agitation-related affect, consistent with self-discrepancy theory. Discussion centers on a view in which an avoidance motive (feared self) dominates anxiety and guilt if the feared element is nearby but in which an associated approach motive (ought self) dominates anxiety and guilt if the feared element is more remote.},

abstract = {In practice, the inclusion of correlated residuals in latent-variable models is often regarded as a statistical sleight of hand, if not an outright form of cheating. Consequently, researchers have tended to allow only as many correlated residuals in their models as are needed to obtain a good fit to the data. The current article demonstrates that this strategy leads to the underinclusion of residual correlations that are completely justified on the basis of measurement theory and research design. In many designs, the absence of such correlations will not substantially harm the fit of the model; however, failure to include them can change the meaning of the extracted latent variables and generate potentially misleading results. Recommendations include (a) returning to the full multitrait-multimethod design when measurement theory implies the existence of shared method variance and (b) abandoning the evil-but-necessary attitude toward correlated residuals when they reflect intended features of the research design.},

abstract = {Research on people's motives for engaging in high-risk activities has typically been viewed through the single-focused lens of sensation seeking. We provide evidence that comprehensively challenges that view. First, we develop and confirm the structure of a 3-factor measure of motives: the Sensation Seeking, Emotion Regulation, and Agency Scale (SEAS; Study 1). We then use the SEAS to provide evidence of differential motives for 2 high-risk activities: skydiving and mountaineering. The motive for skydiving is strongly associated with sensation seeking; the motive for mountaineering is strongly associated with emotion regulation and agency but not with sensation seeking (Study 2). We also show that these conclusions cannot be drawn from existing measures of personality and sensation seeking (Study 3). Finally, individuals who are motivated by emotion regulation and agency needs also have greater expectations regarding their emotion regulation and agency. It is these greater expectations that most successfully discriminate mountaineers from skydivers and control participants (Study 4). It is concluded that researchers should no longer consider risk takers as a homogenous sensation-seeking group and that they should consider risk taking as a potential model of human endeavor. The SEAS can be used as a measure of motives for behavior whenever sensation seeking, agency, or emotion regulation is thought to be at the core of such motives, and the results are discussed in the context of encouraging personality researchers to consider the specific spontaneous behaviors that motivate different people.},

We recognize potential benefits for applied researchers as discussed by Muth{\'{e}}n and Asparouhov, and we also see a tradeoff in that effective use of the proposed approach introduces increased demands in terms of expertise of users to navigate new complexities in model specification, parameter estimation, and evaluation of results. We also raise cautions regarding the issues of model modification and model fit.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: While resilience has been defined as resistance to illness, adaptation, and thriving, the ability to bounce back or recover from stress is closest to its original meaning. Previous resilience measures assess resources that may promote resilience rather than recovery, resistance, adaptation, or thriving. PURPOSE: To test a new brief resilience scale. METHOD: The brief resilience scale (BRS) was created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. Its psychometric characteristics were examined in four samples, including two student samples and samples with cardiac and chronic pain patients. RESULTS: The BRS was reliable and measured as a unitary construct. It was predictably related to personal characteristics, social relations, coping, and health in all samples. It was negatively related to anxiety, depression, negative affect, and physical symptoms when other resilience measures and optimism, social support, and Type D personality (high negative affect and high social inhibition) were controlled. There were large differences in BRS scores between cardiac patients with and without Type D and women with and without fibromyalgia. CONCLUSION: The BRS is a reliable means of assessing resilience as the ability to bounce back or recover from stress and may provide unique and important information about people coping with health-related stressors.},

abstract = {Objective: Frontline health professionals need a "red flag" tool to aid their decision making about whether to make a referral for a full diagnostic assessment for an autism spectrum condition (ASC) in children and adults. The aim was to identify 10 items on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) (Adult, Adolescent, and Child versions) and on the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) with good test accuracy. Method: A case sample of more than 1,000 individuals with ASC (449 adults, 162 adolescents, 432 children and 126 toddlers) and a control sample of 3,000 controls (838 adults, 475 adolescents, 940 children, and 754 toddlers) with no ASC diagnosis participated. Case participants were recruited from the Autism Research Centre's database of volunteers. The control samples were recruited through a variety of sources. Participants completed full-length versions of the measures. The 10 best items were selected on each instrument to produce short versions. Results: At a cut-point of 6 on the AQ-10 adult, sensitivity was 0.88, specificity was 0.91, and positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.85. At a cut-point of 6 on the AQ-10 adolescent, sensitivity was 0.93, specificity was 0.95, and PPV was 0.86. At a cut-point of 6 on the AQ-10 child, sensitivity was 0.95, specificity was 0.97, and PPV was 0.94. At a cut-point of 3 on the Q-CHAT-10, sensitivity was 0.91, specificity was 0.89, and PPV was 0.58. Internal consistency was {\textgreater}0.85 on all measures. Conclusions: The short measures have potential to aid referral decision making for specialist assessment and should be further evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.},

Researchers are generally aware of such pitfalls and often attempt to tailor their analyses to accommodate small samples. Despite well-intentioned efforts, conventional statistical axioms do not always translate to best prac-tice with small samples, and common recommendations can, counterintui-tively, exacerbate small sample problems. In this article, we overview the landscape of small sample techniques and note why conventionally recom-mended approaches can fail with small samples while also suggesting lesser known alternatives that tend to perform better in statistical research but are not widely adopted in education research. Topics include bootstrapping, latent variable model fit, and Bayesian methods for multilevel, latent vari-able, and growth models. Simulated and real-data examples are interspersed throughout.},

This article describes the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO–PI), a measure of these 5 factors and some of the traits that define them, and its use in clinical practice. Recent studies suggest that NEO–PI scales are reliable and valid in clinical samples as in normal samples. The use of self-report personality measures in clinical samples is discussed, and data from 117 "normal" adult men and women are presented to show links between the NEO–PI scales and psychopathology as measured by D. N. Jackson's (1989) Basic Personality Inventory and L. Morey's (1991) Personality Assessment Inventory. The authors argue that the NEO–PI may be useful to clinicians in understanding the patient, formulating a diagnosis, establishing rapport, developing insight, anticipating the course of therapy, and selecting the optimal form of treatment for the patient.},

The EDI is a 64 item, self-report, multiscale meas- ure designed for the assessment of psychological and behavioral traits common in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia. The EDI consists of eight sub- scales measuring: 1) Drive for Thinness, 2) Bulimia, 3) Body Dissatisfaction, 4) Ineffectiveness, 5) Perfectionism, 6) Interpersonal Distrust, 7) Interocep- tive Awareness and 8) Maturity Fears. Reliability (internal consistency) is established for all subscales and several indices of validity are presented. First, AN patients (N = 113) are differentiated from female comparison (FQ subjects (N = 577) using a cross-validation procedure. Secondly, patient self- report subscale scores agree with clinician ratings ofsubscale traits. Thirdly, clinically recovered AN patients score similarly to FCs on all subscales. Finally, convergent and discriminant validity are established for subscales. The EDI was also administered to groups of normal weight bulimic women, obese, and normal weight but formerly obese women, as well as a male com- parison group. Group differences are reported and the potential utility of the EDI is discussed},

The results of an online study with 49 executives enrolled in an Executive MBA program confirmed the hypotheses. The findings are discussed with respect to the theoretical conceptualization of impaired intrinsic motivation as a consequence of motive incongruence. On the basis of our findings, interventions ought to be directed at helping people gain an improved understanding of their implicit motives rather than trusting their perceptions in identifying job stressors that need to be removed.},

@article{Fishbach2006,
abstract = {The self-regulation process often involves breaking an ongoing goal (e.g., keeping in shape) into many individual, constituent subgoals that monitor actual actions (e.g., eating healthy meals, going to the gym). The article examines how pursuing each of these subgoals may influence subsequent goal pursuit. The authors show that when people consider success on a single subgoal, additional actions toward achieving a superordinate goal are seen as substitutes and are less likely to be pursued. In contrast, when people consider their commitment to a superordinate goal on the basis of initial success on a subgoal, additional actions toward achieving that goal may seem to be complementary and more likely to be pursued. These predictions were tested in four studies that explored the conditions under which subgoals attainment have a counterproductive versus favorable effect on further pursuit of similar actions.

abstract = {Background: High-risk activities have typically been explored within a sensation seeking framework. They may, however, allow those with emotional difficulties to experience and regulate their emotions. Methods: Skydivers (n = 87) completed anxiety and heart rate data four times on a single day before and after a skydive. Results: A 2 (group: alexithymic; non alexithymic) × 4 (time) ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor revealed a significant alexithymia × time interaction, F(2.27, 192.60) = 45.48, p {\textless} .001, $\eta$2 = .35. Anxiety fluctuated significantly more for alexithymic skydivers than it did for their non alexithymic counterparts. This interaction was not mirrored by heart rate. The relationship between alexithymia and anxiety remained significant when accounting for sensation seeking. Limitations: The results leave open interpretations that are based on anhedonia, which was not controlled for. Conclusions: Alexithymic individuals may find, in the high-risk domain, an environment that satisfies their emotion regulation needs. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Ferro2014,
abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this research was to examine, in an exploratory manner, whether cross-sectional multiple imputation generates valid parameter estimates for a latent growth curve model in a longitudinal data set with nonmonotone missingness. Methods: A simulated longitudinal data set of N= 5000 was generated and consisted of a continuous dependent variable, assessed at three measurement occasions and a categorical time-invariant independent variable. Missing data had a nonmonotone pattern and the proportion of missingness increased from the initial to the final measurement occasion (5{\%}-20{\%}). Three methods were considered to deal with missing data: listwise deletion, full-information maximum likelihood, and multiple imputation. A latent growth curve model was specified and analysis of variance was used to compare parameter estimates between the full data set and missing data approaches. Results: Multiple imputation resulted in significantly lower slope variance compared with the full data set. There were no differences in any parameter estimates between the multiple imputation and full-information maximum likelihood approaches. Conclusions: This study suggested that in longitudinal studies with nonmonotone missingness, cross-sectional imputation at each time point may be viable and produces estimates comparable with those obtained with full-information maximum likelihood. Future research pursuing the validity of this method is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{HayatiRezvan2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Missing data are common in medical research, which can lead to a loss in statistical power and potentially biased results if not handled appropriately. Multiple imputation (MI) is a statistical method, widely adopted in practice, for dealing with missing data. Many academic journals now emphasise the importance of reporting information regarding missing data and proposed guidelines for documenting the application of MI have been published. This review evaluated the reporting of missing data, the application of MI including the details provided regarding the imputation model, and the frequency of sensitivity analyses within the MI framework in medical research articles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A systematic review of articles published in the Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine between January 2008 and December 2013 in which MI was implemented was carried out.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We identified 103 papers that used MI, with the number of papers increasing from 11 in 2008 to 26 in 2013. Nearly half of the papers specified the proportion of complete cases or the proportion with missing data by each variable. In the majority of the articles (86{\%}) the imputed variables were specified. Of the 38 papers (37{\%}) that stated the method of imputation, 20 used chained equations, 8 used multivariate normal imputation, and 10 used alternative methods. Very few articles (9{\%}) detailed how they handled non-normally distributed variables during imputation. Thirty-nine papers (38{\%}) stated the variables included in the imputation model. Less than half of the papers (46{\%}) reported the number of imputations, and only two papers compared the distribution of imputed and observed data. Sixty-six papers presented the results from MI as a secondary analysis. Only three articles carried out a sensitivity analysis following MI to assess departures from the missing at random assumption, with details of the sensitivity analyses only provided by one article.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This review outlined deficiencies in the documenting of missing data and the details provided about imputation. Furthermore, only a few articles performed sensitivity analyses following MI even though this is strongly recommended in guidelines. Authors are encouraged to follow the available guidelines and provide information on missing data and the imputation process.},

The birthplace and birth month of all American players in the National Hockey League, National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and Professional Golfer's Association, and all Canadian players in the National Hockey League were collected from official websites. Monte Carlo simulations were used to verify if the birthplace of these professional athletes deviated in any systematic way from the official census population distribution, and chi-square analyses were conducted to determine whether the players' birth months were evenly distributed throughout the year. Results showed a birthplace bias towards smaller cities, with professional athletes being over-represented in cities of less than 500,000 and under-represented in cities of 500,000 and over. A birth month/relative age effect (in the form of a distinct bias towards elite athletes being relatively older than their peers) was found for hockey and baseball but not for basketball and golf. Comparative analyses suggested that contextual factors associated with place of birth contribute more influentially to the achievement of an elite level of sport performance than does relative age and that these factors are essentially independent in their influences on expertise development.},

Part I of this series outlined several advantages of Bayesian hypothesis testing, including the ability to quantify evidence and the ability to monitor and update this evidence as data come in, without the need to know the intention with which the data were collected. Despite these and other practical advantages, Bayesian hypothesis tests are still reported relatively rarely. An important impediment to the widespread adoption of Bayesian tests is arguably the lack of user-friendly software for the run-of-the-mill statistical problems that confront psychologists for the analysis of almost every experiment: the t-test, ANOVA, correlation, regression, and contingency tables. In Part II of this series we introduce JASP (http://www.jasp-stats.org), an open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly graphical software package that allows users to carry out Bayesian hypothesis tests for standard statistical problems. JASP is based in part on the Bayesian analyses implemented in Morey and Rouder's BayesFactor package for R.

abstract = {Purpose – This paper seeks to examine the relationship between individuals' developmental mentoring networks and a subjective career outcome, clarity of professional identity. How developmental network characteristics are related to professional identity over time is explored. Design/methodology/approach – This is a three-wave, longitudinal survey study, covering a five-year span (1996-2001). The participants (n ¼ 136), full-time MBA students at the inception of the study, provided complete developmental network data on each survey. The relationships between clarity of professional identity and three different measures of developmental network density were explored: early-career density; general density; and density dynamics (e.g. the change in density over time). Findings – Developmental network density, which reflects the professional identity exploration process, is negatively related to clarity of professional identity. Research limitations/implications – The study is limited by the use of graduating MBA students from a single, top-20 business school as participants. Practical implications – The findings suggest that people might be able to improve their careers through changing their developmental networks, particularly during their early-career years. Originality/value – This paper provides novel insights to the mentoring, identity, and careers literatures. Given the previously uncharted territory of understanding the dynamics of developmental networks and its relationship to career outcomes, this study opens avenues for future research, while also answering questions about developmental networks and the ways they function over time.

abstract = {Two Monte Carlo studies were conducted to examine the sensitivity of goodness of fit indexes to lack of measurement invariance at 3 commonly tested levels: factor loadings, intercepts, and residual variances. Standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) appears to be more sensitive to lack of invariance in factor loadings than in intercepts or residual variances. Comparative fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) appear to be equally sensitive to all 3 types of lack of invariance. The most intriguing finding is that changes in fit statistics are affected by the interaction between the pattern of invariance and the proportion of invariant items: when the pattern of lack of invariance is uniform, the relation is nonmonotonic, whereas when the pattern of lack of invariance is mixed, the relation is monotonic. Unequal sample sizes affect changes across all 3 levels of invariance: Changes are bigger when sample sizes are equal rather than when they are unequal. Cutoff points for testing invariance at different levels are recommended. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.},

@article{Richardson1987,
abstract = {This research investigates the antecedents of psychosocial impacts of the TMI nuclear power plant accident. A model of factors that are hypothesized to affect impact levels is developed and configured to approximate a hypothetical causal sequence. Using data from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission telephone survey, the technique of path analysis is used to test relationships in the model. The results show that the antecedents explain 12{\%} of the variance in individual stress, 45{\%} of the variance in family disruption, and 16{\%} of the variance in perceived community change. The analysis shows that the TMI specific attitudes and sensitivity to radiation risks are strong antecedents of impacts. Although general attitudes toward nuclear power have minor indirect effects, it appears that situational experiences with the accident are the major contributors toward explaing impact levels.},

Furthermore, few researchers evaluate both systems in one model. We evaluated the relationship between Carver and White's (1994) BIS/BAS Scales and areas of psychological functioning including intenalizing, externalizing, affect regulation, and well-being. 497 undergraduates completed a battery of self-report measures. Two structural equation models indicate that the Reward Responsiveness subscale uniquely predicts adaptive functioning across all domains. Reward Responsiveness may be a more pure measure of BAS than other BAS traits and may be important for resilience from maladaptive psychological functioning.},

abstract = {Our personalities (who we are) influence our social relationships (how we relate to people around us), and our social relationships influence our personalities. However, little is known about the specific processes underlying the complex interplay of personality and social relationships. According to the PERSOC framework, the identification of underlying social interaction processes promotes the understanding of how personality and social relationships are expressed, develop, and influence each other over time. The aim of the present paper is twofold: First, we outline and discuss four methodological challenges that arise when trying to empirically realize a process approach to the personality-relationship interplay. Second, we describe two data sets that are designed to meet these challenges and that are open for collaborative investigations: a laboratory-based process approach (Personality Interaction Laboratory Study; PILS) and a field-based process approach (CONNECT). We provide detailed information on the samples (two student samples; PILS: N = 311; CONNECT: N = 131), procedures (longitudinal and multimethodological), and measures (personality and social relationships, appearance and behavior, interpersonal perceptions), for which we present descriptive information, reliabilities, and intercorrelations. We summarize how these studies' designs targeted the introduced methodological challenges, discuss the advantages and limitations of laboratory- and field-based process approaches, and call for their combination. We close by outlining an open research policy, aimed at accelerated collaborative efforts to further open the process black box, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the expression, development, and complex interplay of personality and social relationships.},

A number of mood scales have been created to measure these factors; however, many existing measures are inadequate, showing low reliability or poor convergent or discriminant validity. To fill the need for reliable and valid Positive Affect and Negative Affect scales that are also brief and easy to administer, we developed two 10-item mood scales that comprise the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The scales are shown to be highly internally consistent, largely uncorrelated, and stable at appropriate levels over a 2-month time period. Normative data and factorial and external evidence of convergent and discriminant validity for the scales are also presented.},

LPA thus assumes that people can be typed with varying degrees of probabilities into categories that have different configural profiles of personal and/or environmental attributes. Within this article, we (a) review the existing applications of LPA within past vocational behavior research; (b) illustrate best practice procedures in a non-technical way of how to use LPA methodology, with an illustrative example of identifying different latent profiles of heavy work investment (i.e., working compulsively, working excessively, and work engagement); and (c) outline future research possibilities in vocational behavior research. By reviewing 46 studies stemming from central journals of the field, we identified seven distinct topics that have already been investigated by LPA (e.g., job and organizational attitudes and behaviors, work motivation, career-related attitudes and orientations, vocational interests). Together with showing descriptive statistics about how LPA has been conducted in past vocational behavior research, we illustrate and derive best-practice recommendations for future LPA research. The review and “how to” guide can be helpful for all researchers interested in conducting LPA studies.},

We apply them to a highly relevant causality question in life course and health inequality research: does socioeconomic status (SES) affect health (social causation) or does health affect SES (health selection)? Using retrospective survey data from SHARELIFE covering life courses from childhood to old age, the cross-lagged model suggests an equal importance of social causation and health selection; the LGM stresses the effect of education on health growth; whereas the ALT model confirms no causality. We discuss examples, present short and non-technical introduction of each method, and illustrate them by highlighting their relative strengths for causal life course analysis.},

A secondary aim was to explore differences between student-athletes and non-athletes in the sources of self-efficacy information. Sixty-three college students completed measures of self-efficacy, sources of self-efficacy information, and performed trials of the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle, a wooden puzzle solving test requiring participants to move wooden pieces from one point to another in a specific order. Quantitative results revealed hierarchical performance self-efficacy for the number of moves required and time required to solve the puzzle significantly changed across the four trials. Qualitative results indicated verbal and imaginal experiences were the two most prominent sources of participants' self-efficacy information on trial 1, but by trial 4 mastery experiences and verbal information were the most prominent sources, also suggesting that that the influence of self-efficacy sources may change over time. Implications for practitioners to assist individuals with novel cognitive tasks are discussed.},

abstract = {Although avalanche training and the risk minimization strategies have greatly evolved and are being widely taught to recreational and professional users, too many serious accidents continue to happen within the educated user groups. Whereas misinterpretation of the hazards as well as the com- plexity and uncertainty of hazard assessment are potential causes for such accidents, a faulty perception of the probabilities of accidents and their implications might be a more important factor, in particular with trained user groups. Although absolute numbers of terrain users and accidents can only be estimated, it is reasonable to as- sume that the case fatality rate of recreational activities in avalanche terrain has decreased considerably over the last 30 years. Despite all these efforts and the higher level of awareness, the pattern in the re- maining accidents in many countries remains the same. The key to the reduction of future accidents might not be in increased investments within the traditional fields which are already part of avalanche awareness and training in most countries, but a higher level of awareness on how to interpret the proba- bilities and potential consequences. This calls for a higher level of understanding on how low-probability / high consequence events can to be transformed to real life decision-making. Comparisons with activities including similar case fatality rates are not easy as there are only few activities with so few regulations left as in mountain sport activities. Furthermore, different utility functions within user groups influence the risk behavior. Finally we suggest ways of dealing with risk perception in curricula for avalanche courses.},

abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions, although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrich's achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by J{\"{o}}reskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings usually leads to distorted factors with overestimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This article describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameters and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test-retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated and real data are used to illustrate the points. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Statistical mediation analysis is used to investigate intermediate variables in the relation between independent and dependent variables. Causal interpretation of mediation analyses is challenging because randomization of subjects to levels of the independent variable does not rule out the possibility of unmeasured confounders of the mediator to outcome relation. Furthermore, commonly used frequentist methods for mediation analysis compute the probability of the data given the null hypothesis, which is not the probability of a hypothesis given the data as in Bayesian analysis. Under certain assumptions, applying the potential outcomes framework to mediation analysis allows for the computation of causal effects, and statistical mediation in the Bayesian framework gives indirect effects probabilistic interpretations. This tutorial combines causal inference and Bayesian methods for mediation analysis so the indirect and direct effects have both causal and probabilistic interpretations. Steps in Bayesian causal mediation analysis are shown in the application to an empirical example.},

abstract = {The French Mountain Guides Association3 (Syndicat National des Guides de Montagne,) organises continuing training for its members. Since 1998, the focus of the training involves around mountain risks in the winter, in 2003 it will be re-evaluated. The training is designed to give guides a better appreciation of the dangers they are likely to encounter, enabling them to take the necessary precautions. The objective is to reduce the number of accidents and the number of victims. Four years into the programme, the impact of the avalanche awareness training can be assessed. The effectiveness of the course is measured both by the numerous written remarks made by the trainee guides, and by the instruction reports drawn up by the instructor guides. The success of the programme is evaluated by analysing the avalanche accidents involving French Mountain Guides. This approach has lead us to completely change the avalanche course. The section devoted to the evolution and study of snow crystals and the snow-pack has been reduced, while the part devoted to the explanation of the avalanche triggering mechanism and to the study of real cases has been increased. These cases include accidents that have been the subject of expert appraisals by the Guides Association. We have put the emphasis on remote triggering phenomena, on the dangers related to thin snow covers, and on the difficulties in analysing snow-packs that often are very heterogeneous over short distances. A new avalanche typology has been created, on which the course is now based. Situations have been classified according to our current ability or inability to predict whether avalanches are likely to occur.{\S}},

However, it is less clear how life events interact with personality factors in forming individual resilience. Thus, the present study investigates the mediating effects of the two main complementary personality dimensions extraversion and neuroticism on the relationship between life events and resilience in adulthood. Traumatic Antecedent Questionnaire (TAQ), NEO-Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) and Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) were administered to 201 healthy subjects. Results from path analyses (AMOS) revealed that the personality factors neuroticism and extraversion (measured by NEO-FFI) fully mediated the association between positive life events and resilience. This is the first study to date using psychometric assessment to explore the possible pathways from positive/negative life experiences to resilience.},

abstract = {The current study developed and tested a model of the interplay among goal difficulty, goal progress, and expectancy over time in influencing resource allocation toward competing demands. The results provided broad support for the theoretical model. As predicted, dual-goal expectancy-the perceived likelihood of meeting both goals in competition-played a central role, moderating the relationship between relative goal progress and resource allocation. Dual-goal difficulty was also found to exert an important influence on multiple-goal self-regulation. Although it did not influence total productivity across both tasks combined, it did combine with other model components to influence the relative emphasis of one task over another. These results suggest that the cumulative demands placed by multiple difficult goals may exceed individuals' perceived capabilities and may lead to partial or total abandonment of 1 goal to ensure attainment of the other. The model helps shed light on some of the conflicting theoretical propositions and empirical results obtained in prior work. Implications for theory and research regarding multiple-goal self-regulation are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Background: The prescribing of antidepressants has been rising dramatically in developed countries. Aim: As part of an investigation into the reasons for the rise and variation in the prescribing of antidepressants, this study aimed to describe, and account for, the variation in an age-sex standardised rate of antidepressant prescribing between general practices. Design of study: Cross-sectional study involving analyses of routinely available data. Setting: A total of 983 Scottish general practices. Method: Age-sex standardised prescribing rates were calculated for each practice. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were undertaken to examine how the variation in prescribing was related to population, GP, and practice characteristics at individual practice level. Results: There was a 4.6-fold difference between the first and ninth deciles of antidepressant prescribing, standardised for registered patients' age and sex composition. The multivariate model explained 49.4{\%} of the variation. Significantly higher prescribing than expected was associated with more limiting long-term illness (highly correlated with deprivation and the single most influential factor), urban location, and a greater proportion of female GPs in the practices. Significantly lower prescribing than expected was associated with single-handed practices, a higher than average list size, a greater proportion of GP partners born outside the UK, remote rural areas, a higher proportion of patients from minority ethnic groups, a higher mean GP age, and availability of psychology services. None of the quality-of-care indicators investigated was associated with prescribing levels. Conclusion: Almost half of the variation in the prescription of antidepressants can be explained using population, GP, and practice characteristics. Initiatives to reduce the prescribing of antidepressants should consider these factors to avoid denying appropriate treatment to patients in some practices. {\textcopyright} British Journal of General Practice.},

For these data, there is a well established ESEM structure but typical CFA models do not fit the data and substantially inflate correlations among the nine SET factors (median rs D .34 for ESEM, .72 for CFA) in a way that undermines discriminant validity and usefulness as diagnostic feedback. A 13-model taxonomy of ESEM measurement invariance is proposed, showing complete invariance (factor loadings, factor correlations, item uniquenesses, item intercepts, latent means) over multiple groups based on the SETs collected in the first and second halves of a 13-year period. Fully latent ESEM growth models that unconfounded measurement error from communality showed almost no linear or quadratic effects over this 13-year period. Latent multiple indicators multiple causes models showed that relations with background variables (workload/difficulty, class size, prior subject interest, expected grades) were small in size and varied systematically for different ESEM SET factors, supporting their discriminant validity and a construct validity interpretation of the relations. A new approach to higher order ESEM was demonstrated, but was not fully appropriate for these data. Based on ESEM methodology, substantively important questions were addressed that could not be appropriately addressed with a traditional CFA approach.},

Solutions are given for missing data challenges such as handling longitudinal, categorical, and clustered data with normal-model MI; including interactions in the missing data model; and handling large numbers of variables. The discussion of attrition and nonignorable missingness emphasizes the need for longitudinal diagnostics and for reducing the uncertainty about the missing data mechanism under attrition. Strategies suggested for reducing attrition bias include using auxiliary variables, collecting follow-up data on a sample of those initially missing, and collecting data on intent to drop out.

abstract = {Culturally comparative studies about test anxiety often use adaptations of the two- dimensional Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI; Spielberger, 1980). To capture multiple facets of test anxiety, however, no multidimensional instrument with transcultural validity exits. In response, the current study reports on the cross-validation of an English version of the four-dimensional TAI-G, which had been introduced as an extended German adaptation of the TAI (Hodapp, 1991, 1996). First year university students of a multi-ethnic South African (N=102) and German sample (N=183) were given parallel versions of the TAI-G in English and German. Multigroup confirmatory factor models were conducted to examine structural and parametric invariance. Indicating high construct validity, a second-order model of test anxiety fits the data well for both samples. Associations with test anxiety correlates suggested high criterion validity. Scale structure and psychometric properties of the English TAI-G replicated findings of German samples suggesting transcultural applicability of the measure.},

It was hypothesized that cognitive failure would directly predict safety behavior and workplace accidents and predict these outcomes over and above conscientiousness. It was found that cognitive failure uniquely accounted for workplace safety behavior and accidents. However, it has been suggested by researchers that certain individual differences might interact to produce differential effects. Thus, a moderated model was tested examining the interaction of cognitive failure and conscientiousness. It was found that cognitive failure moderated the relationship between conscientiousness and accidents and unsafe work behaviors. Overall, results suggest that cognitive failure plays an important part in individual safety behavior, especially when conscientiousness is low.},

abstract = {This study extends the limited body of research exploring the association between psychological resources and performance under pressure. It was anticipated that participants' general self-efficacy and resilience would positively influence skill acquisition rate more under high pressure, than low pressure. Eighty-one undergraduate students (M age = 22.93; SD = 7.53; 50.6{\%} female) participated in a learning task: to fly a flight simulator. The within-subjects variable was the participant's ability to steadily control the aircraft roll across six trials. Psychological pressure was manipulated between-subjects and general self-efficacy and resilience were measured moderator variables. Findings indicated that under high pressure, higher levels of general self-efficacy and perceived resilience predicted faster initial skill acquisition compared to those with lower levels of these resources. In contrast, in the low-pressure condition, the skill acquisition rate was the same irrespective of psychological resources. This research highlights the importance of psychological resources in pressured training contexts. Keywords employee performance, mental health, stress and burnout, training, industrial and organisational psychology Psychological pressure refers to the perceiver's belief that the situation has high stakes for performance (Baumeis-ter, 1984; Gucciardi et al., 2010). Cognitive ability is of known importance to skill development (e.g., Frydman {\&} Lynn, 1992); however, when the learning situation be-comes pressured, the individual's capacity to manage such pressure is likely to become critical to skill acquisition. Previous research has demonstrated a negative relation-ship between anxiety and a range of learning outcomes including skill acquisition (Colquitt et al., 2000). Yet, inter-individual differences in the way people respond to psychological pressure and situational demands have made it difficult to determine how anxiety and stress im-pact performance (Vine et al., 2014). The ability to man-age the experience of pressure during training is likely to be of importance to the acquisition rate of new skills. This research examines the role of psychological resources (i.e., general self-efficacy (GSE) and resilience) in moderating the relationship between psychological pressure and skill acquisition. Specifically, we anticipated that GSE and re-silience will facilitate the rate of skill acquisition under psychological pressure suggesting a 'buffering' role for psychological resources in the relationship between psy-chological pressure and skill acquisition.},

The sport-specific measure of task and ego orientation was found to have a stable factor structure and high internal consistency. Factor analysis of the Purpose of Sport Questionnaire revealed seven factors: sport should (a) teach the value of mastery and cooperation, (b) show people how to be physically active for life, (c) make good citizens, (d) make people competitive, (e) help individuals obtain a high status career, (f) enhance self-esteem, and (g) show people how to get ahead and increase their social status. Results indicated that the importance placed on skill mastery and personal improvement in sport (task orientation) positively related to the beliefs that sport should enhance self-esteem and teach people to try their test, cooperate, and be good citizens. Ego orientation was a positive predictor of the view that sport involvement should enhance one's self-esteem and social status.},

Consequently, researchers have tended to allow only as many correlated residuals in their models as are needed to obtain a good fit to the data. The current article demonstrates that this strategy leads to the underinclusion of residual correlations that are completely justified on the basis of measurement theory and research design. In many designs, the absence of such correlations will not substantially harm the fit of the model; however, failure to include them can change the meaning of the extracted latent variables and generate potentially misleading results. Recommendations include (a) returning to the full multitrait-multimethod design when measurement theory implies the existence of shared method variance and (b) abandoning the evil-but-necessary attitude toward correlated residuals when they reflect intended features of the research design.},

This research has yielded some important findings (e.g., the very strong link between generalized anxiety disorder and the unipolar mood disorders). I discuss problems associated with disorder-based analyses, however, and I argue that they need to be supplemented by examining relations among the specific symptom dimensions within these diagnostic classes. I demonstrate that two quantitative elements need to be considered when analyzing the properties of symptoms-the level of specificity and the magnitude of the general distress variance. These quantitative elements can be used to organize relevant symptoms into four groups (i.e., a quadripartite model) that reflect varying combinations of distress and specificity. I illustrate the value of this approach by reviewing the properties of the major symptom dimensions within posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depression.},

Results revealed a subset of 18 features, from 658 collected, discriminated between super-elite and elite batsmen with excellent classification accuracy (96{\%}). The external validity of this new model is evidenced also by its ability to classify correctly the data obtained from six unseen batsmen with 100{\%} accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that super-elite batsmen undertook a larger volume of skills-based practice that was both more random, and more varied in nature, at age 16. They subsequently adapted to, and transitioned across, the different levels of senior competition quicker. The findings suggest that optimizing challenge at a psychological and technical level is a catalyst for the development of (super-elite) expertise.

abstract = {While researchers are devoting their efforts for decades to improve avalanche forecasting, it still appears that the victims are almost always surprised: they either did not expect at all an avalanche at the time, or they never imagined they were of such magnitude. However, it is sometimes the best professionals who are involved, the ones who should have avoided the accident completely, or limit its severity, if they had been aware of the danger. To minimize the effect of surprise, current methods of risk reduction are not fully satisfactory. On the contrary, assuming that the avalanche is predictable, they reinforce the user sometimes in dangerous beliefs. Therefore we explored the idea of "bounded vigilance model" proposed by Ian McCammon in 2009. Thus, on the basis of simple, measurable and debatable parameters, the objective is to determine which mode of vigilance is required: relax mode, concerned mode, alert mode or... hazardous mode. The goal is no longer to predict the avalanche (which does not generally occur), but to be better prepared for the unexpected. From here, there are clearly opportunities for danger avoidance, risk reduction or reconsidering the entire project. I have adopted this practice for helping decision making during cross-country skiing, track-setting for ski mountaineering races ... or for risk management on the access roads to the biggest ski resorts in the Alps. This is also taught in the training of French guides and ski instructors. 1.{\S}},

abstract = {Knowledge of the training requirements and environmental factors associated with expert sports performance is essential for the design of effective sport programs and the creation of nurturing practice environments. However, several limitations in the sport expertise development literature restrict the application of current knowledge to practical settings. Results and recommendations from existing studies are inconsistent, with discrepancies likely related to a combination of small, homogenous sample sizes and differences in measurement tools. Furthermore, the questionnaires and interview guides utilized are generally poorly validated. To begin to address these limitations, the Developmental History of Athletes Questionnaire (DHAQ) was constructed and rigorously validated. Results highlighted a number of issues related to reliability of retrospective recall and sub-optimal questionnaire design. In an attempt to resolve these issues, modifications were made to the DHAQ, and it was converted to an online format to allow large scale distribution. Following modification and conversion, the DHAQ was subjected to further reliability analyses. While several reliability issues were still apparent and several further revisions were required, the amendments markedly strengthened the measurement tool and the DHAQ can now start to be utilised in investigations of sport expertise development. Continued assessments of validity of the updated, online DHAQ are recommended; however, it is proposed that the DHAQ be considered the emergent standard tool for the collection of athlete developmental history information, providing a major contribution towards a comprehensive understanding of the development of sport expertise.},

As hypothesized, goal-performance discrepancies were significantly related to subsequent time allocation. Greater distance from a given goal resulted in greater time subsequently allocated to that goal. In addition, the incentives offered for goal attainment determined the relative influence of discrepancies for each goal. When the incentives for each goal were equivalent, progress toward each goal exhibited equal influence, with greater time allocated to whichever goal was furthest from completion at the time. However, with an incentive available for only 1 of the 2 goals, time allocation was largely determined by progress toward the rewarded goal. Likewise, when incentives for each task differed in their approach-avoidance framing, progress toward the avoidance-framed goal was a stronger predictor of subsequent allocation than was progress toward the approach-framed goal. Finally, the influence of goal-performance discrepancies differed as a function of the time remaining for goal pursuit. The implications for future work on dynamic goal prioritization and the provision of performance incentives are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Psychological Association.},

M. Gollwitzer, 1993) is explored by assessing the completion rate of various goal projects. In correlational Study 1, difficult goal intentions were completed about 3 times more often when participants had furnished them with implementation intentions. In experimental Study 2, all participants were assigned the same difficult goal intention, and half were instructed to form implementation intentions. The beneficial effects of implementation intentions paralleled those of Study 1. In experimental Study 3, implementation intentions were observed to facilitate the immediate initiation of goal-directed action when the intended opportunity was encountered. Implementation intentions are interpreted to be powerful self-regulatory tools for overcoming the typical obstacles associated with the initiation of goal-directed actions.},

abstract = {Emotion dysregulation often emerges early in development and is a core feature of many psychological conditions. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) is a well validated and widely used self-report measure for assessing emotion regulation problems among adolescents and adults. The DERS has six subscales with five to eight items each (36 total), suggesting multiple questions may assess similar underlying constructs. In an effort to reduce respondent burden and streamline this widely-used instrument, we created a short-form version of the DERS (DERS-SF) using confirmatory factor analysis on data from three adolescent (n = 257) and two adult samples (n = 797). Scores on the DERS-SF yielded similar correlation patterns relative to the full measure, ranging from .90 to .98 and reflecting 81–96 {\%} shared variance. This instrument maintains the excellent psychometric properties and retains the total and subscale scores of the original measure with half the items.},

One source of stress is intrapersonal psychological conflict as caused by discrepancies between implicit and explicit motives. In the present research, we examined whether eating behavior is related to this form of stress. Study 1 (N=53), a quasi-experimental study in the lab, showed that the interaction between the implicit achievement motive disposition and explicit commitment toward an achievement task significantly predicts the number of snacks consumed in a consecutive taste test. In cross-sectional Study 2 (N=100), with a sample of middle-aged women, overall motive discrepancy was significantly related to diverse indices of unsettled eating. Regression analyses revealed interaction effects specifically for power and achievement motivation and not for affiliation. Emotional distress further partially mediated the relationship between the overall motive discrepancy and eating behavior.},

abstract = {Personal strivings refer to the characteristic types of goals that individuals try to achieve through their everyday behavior. This study examined relations between characteristics of these personal goal strivings (e.g., importance, past attainment, effort) and components of subjective well-being (positive and negative affect and life satisfaction). Subjects generated lists of their personal strivings and rated each striving on a series of dimensions. Subjects also recorded their moods and thoughts by use of an experience-sampling method on 84 occasions over a 3-week period. Positive affect was found to be most strongly related to striving value and past fulfillment, whereas negative affect was associated with low probability of future success, striving ambivalence, and between-striving conflict. Striving importance and instrumentality (low conflict) were the strongest predictors of life satisfaction. Possible explanations for the connections between striving fulfillment and positive affect and between striving conflict and negative affect are discussed. It is concluded that the concept of personal striving is a useful heuristic device for understanding individual differences in subjective well-being. In addition, the concept is promoted as an alternative to the traditional trait approach to personality. {\textcopyright} 1986 American Psychological Association.},

The past performance/self-efficacy within-person corrected correlation was .40 and remained positive and significant ($\rho$ = .30) when controlling for the linear trajectory. The moderator results revealed that at the within-person level of analysis: (a) self-efficacy had at best a moderate, positive effect on performance and a null effect under other moderating conditions ($\rho$ ranged from -.02 to .33); (b) the main effect of past performance on self-efficacy was stronger than the effect of self-efficacy on performance, even in the moderating conditions that produced the strongest self-efficacy/performance relationship; (c) the effect of past performance on self-efficacy ranged from moderate to strong across moderating conditions and was statistically significant across performance tasks, contextual factors, and methodological moderators ($\rho$ ranged from .18 to .52).

Research suggests during abstinence these athletes may experience withdrawal states characteristic of individuals with an addiction (Celsi, Rose, {\&} Leigh, 1993; Franken, Zijlstra, {\&} Muris, 2006; Willig, 2008). Despite this notion, no research has directly explored withdrawal experiences of extreme sports athletes. Methods: Using semi-structured interviews, we explored withdrawal experiences of high (n = 4) and average-ability (n = 4) male rock climbers during periods of abstinence. We investigated the psychological and behavioral aspects of withdrawal, including craving, anhedonia, and negative affect; and differences in the frequency and intensity of these states between groups. Results: Deductive content analysis indicated support for each of the three categories of anhedonia, craving, and negative affect. Consistent with existing substance addiction literature, high-ability climbers recalled more frequent and intense craving states and negative affect during abstinence compared with average-ability climbers. No differences in anhedonic symptoms between high and average-ability participants were found. Conclusions: Rock climbing athletes appear to experience withdrawal symptoms when abstinent from their sport comparable to individuals with substance and behavioral addictions. The implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them.

Does avalanche education really make a difference? This study investigated the relationship between avalanche education and victim behavior in 344 recreational U.S. accidents, and found that victims with more avalanche training did in fact take fewer overall risks. However, all of the risk reduction in trained recreationists can be attributed to better miti - gation measures taken by these victims. None of the risk reduction appeared to be the result of trained groups exposing themselves to less hazard. In fact, victims with basic formal training exposed themselves to more hazard than any other group, including those with no awareness of avalanches. In light of recent findings in decision science, these results suggest that behaviorist and naturalistic teaching strategies would be effective in improving avalanche education. KEYWORDS:},

Talent identification results in the streamlining of resources to produce optimal returns from a sports investment. However, the process of talent identification for team sports is complex and success prediction is imperfect. The aim of this review is to describe existing practices in physiological tests used for talent identification in team sports and discuss the impact of maturity-related differences on the long term outcomes particularly for male participants. Maturation is a major confounding variable in talent identification during adolescence. A myriad of hormonal changes during puberty results in physical and physiological characteristics important for sporting performance. Significant changes during puberty make the prediction of adult performance difficult from adolescent data. Furthermore, for talent identification programs to succeed, valid and reliable testing procedures must be accepted and implemented in a range of performance-related categories. Limited success in scientifically based talent identification is evident in a range of team sports. Genetic advances challenge the ethics of talent identification in adolescent sport. However, the environment remains a significant component of success prediction in sport. Considerations for supporting talented young male athletes are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Sports Medicine Australia.},

This is an important development that adequately addresses Cohen's (1994) The Earth is Round (p {\textless} .05), which stresses that point null-hypotheses are so precise that small and irrelevant differences from the null-hypothesis may lead to their rejection. It is tempting to evaluate small variance priors using readily available approaches like the posterior predictive p value and the DIC. However, as will be shown, both are not suited for the evaluation of models based on small variance priors. In this article, a well behaving alternative, the prior-posterior predictive p value, will be introduced. It will be shown that it is consistent, the distributions under the null and alternative hypotheses will be elaborated, and it will be applied to testing whether the difference between 2 means and the size of a correlation are relevantly different from zero.},

abstract = {Avalanche Forecasting in the Highlands of Scotland presents many challenges for the Sportscotland Avalanche Information Service forecast team, the maritime climate and latitude of the operational areas ensure that the weather patterns are complex and often severe, the snowpack is varied and the stability changes rapid. Additionally, the user groups commonly carry out their mountain activities in poor weather conditions, a factor influencing the SAIS operational methods. In this paper we will describe the geography, landscape and reason for the location of the five SAIS observation areas and present an impression of the working conditions and method in an environment and weather system that can produce winds of 176mph (283kph) and frequently 40-70mph (65-120kph) and consider the characteristics of the Scottish snowpack. We will present the avalanche occurrences observed in the 5 areas for the winter 08/09 relating the findings to weather conditions at the time and the stated avalanche hazard, establishing that the avalanche occurrences occurred predominantly during the snow storm-cycles. Unlike in Alpine countries the mountain user groups who carry out walking and climbing excursions in the Scottish Highlands are mainly on foot, with very small numbers on ski. Their general behaviour and objectives are influenced by the scarcity of good climbing and stable weather conditions. Therefore it is common practice to carry out activities in poor weather and during considerable hazard conditions. In this regard we will look at data from the winter of 08/09 to identify if indeed, avalanche incidents involving people, occurred during periods of considerable hazard and poor weather.},

abstract = { Two studies explored coach education imagery interventions. In Study 1, 29 performance coaches were randomly assigned to either an imagery workshop group ( n = 13) or an imagery-reading comparison control group ( n = 16). Pre and post intervention, coaches completed the CEAIUQ (Jedlic, Hall, Munroe-Chandler, {\&} Hall, 2007) and a confidence questionnaire designed for the study. Further, coaches' athletes completed the CIAIUQ (Jedlic et al., 2007) at pre and post intervention. Due to a poor response rate ( n = 9), an exploratory case study approach was employed to present the data. Results revealed that, while all coaches found the workshop to be interesting and useful, with certain coaches, encouragement of specific aspects of imagery decreased as did confidence to deliver imagery. To overcome the limitations of Study 1, Study 2 employed a needs based approach. Five elite coaches completed a performance profile related to imagery and the CEAIUQ. Four individualized sessions were then conducted. Inspection of post intervention data indicated that the intervention increased encouragement of imagery use, imagery constructs identified as important by the individual coaches, and, when identified, confidence to deliver imagery. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of coach education from both an applied and research perspective. },

@phdthesis{Barlow2012,
abstract = {Research pertaining to the motives for participation in high-risk sport has typically been based on Zuckerman's sensation seeking theory (for a review see Zuckerman 2007). From this stand-point, high-risk sport participants are a considered a homogenous group who participate for the "sensation rewards" of their high-risk activity (Zuckerman, 2007, p. 13). The present thesis provides evidence that comprehensively challenges that view. Many high-risk sports do appear to involve a large element of thrill, excitement, and a plethora of potentially pleasurable sensations. For example, skydiving appears to typify highrisk activities that elicit an intense hedonic experience while participating (Celsi, Rose, {\&} Leigh, 1993; Lipscombe, 1999). However, participation in prolonged engagement high-risk sport, such expeditionary mountaineering (Lester, 1983, 2004), seems to reflect an experience that is antonymous to sensation seeking; individuals engaged in these activities undergo hardship, suffering, and monotony on a daily basis (Loewenstein, 1999). Based on the foundational work of Lester (1983, 2004), Woodman, Hardy, Barlow {\&} Le Scanff(2010) identified that emotion regulation and agency may be key constructs underpinning the motives driving participation in mountaineering. Emotion regulation is the term used to characterize the diverse processes involved in initiating, maintaining, and modulating the intensity, type, or duration of emotions (Gross {\&} Thompson, 2007). To be an agent is to influence intentionally one's functioning and life circumstances. An agentic self presumes active and causal contributions to behaviour and development: the self is the author of internal states such as intent, belief, and desire (Bandura, 2006). Chapter 1 introduces and develops the foundational theoretical rationale on which the present research is based. Chapter 2 develops and confirms the structure of a three-factor measure of the motives that underlie participation in high-risk sports across three time points (between, during, and after participating in the activity): the Sensation seeking, Emotion regulation and Agency Scale (SEAS; Study 1 and Study 2). The SEAS is then used to provide evidence for the differential motives for skydiving and mountaineering: the motive for skydiving is strongly associated with sensation seeking; the motive for mountaineering is strongly associated with emotion regulation and agency, not with sensation seeking (Study 3 and Study 4). Results confirm that mountaineers have a perceived difficulty with emotion regulation and agency in everyday life, but importantly also have a greater expectation about what it means to be successful in emotion regulation and agency terms. It is these greater expectations that most successfully discriminate mountaineers from skydivers and control participants (Study 4). Chapter 3 addresses three specific questions that arise from Chapter 2. Firstly, to what extent do mountaineers display a counter-phobic attitude? Secondly, do mountaineers exhibit generic exaggerated expectancies, of how life ought to be, across all important domains and aspects of everyday life? Thirdly, to what extent do mountaineers experience a romantic attachment to the mountains? A novel qualitative mixed-model approach is employed. Semi-structured in-depth interviews with five of Britain's best expeditionary mountaineers are combined with an abstraction of the mountaineering media (books, interviews, films, etc.). Results include extended raw quotes from mountaineers with the aim that the data may speak for itself and that the voices of the participants' would be heard (Clandinin {\&} Connelly, 2000). Results from the present thesis suggest that researchers should no longer consider participants of expeditionary high-risk activities as a homogenous sensation seeking group. Furthermore, mountaineering may provide participants with a means of attaining their exaggerated expectancies (of agency and emotion regulation) in a way that is perceived as not readily available to them in everyday life.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study examined the determinants of pacing strategy and performance during self-paced maximal exercise. Methods: Eight well-trained cyclists completed two 20-km time trials. Power output, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), positive and negative affect, and iEMG activity of the active musculature were recorded every 0.5 km, confidence in achieving preexercise goals was assessed every 5 km, and blood lactate and pH were measured postexercise. Differences in all parameters were assessed between fastest (FAST) and slowest (SLOW) trials performed. Results: Mean power output was significantly higher during the initial 90{\%} of FAST, but not the final 10{\%}, and blood lactate concentration was significantly higher and pH significantly lower following FAST. Mean iEMG activity was significantly higher throughout SLOW. Rating of perceived exertion was similar throughout both trials, but participants had significantly more positive affect and less negative affect throughout FAST. Participants grew less confident in their ability to achieve their goals throughout SLOW. Conclusions: The results suggest that affect may be the primary psychological regulator of pacing strategy and that higher levels of positivity and lower levels of negativity may have been associated with a more aggressive strategy during FAST. Although the exact mechanisms through which affect acts to influence performance are unclear, it may determine the degree of physiological disruption that can be tolerated, or be reflective of peripheral physiological status in relation to the still to be completed exercise task. {\textcopyright} 2012 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract Psychological resilience is important in sport because athletes must utilise and optimise a range of mental qualities to withstand the pressures that they experience. In this article, we discuss psychological resilience in sport performers via a review of the stressors athletes encounter and the protective factors that help them withstand these demands. It is hoped that synthesising what is known in these areas will help researchers gain a deeper profundity of resilience in sport, and also provide a rigorous and robust foundation for the development of a sport-specific measure of resilience. With these points in mind, we divided the narrative into two main sections. In the first section, we review the different types of stressors encountered by sport performers under three main categories: competitive, organisational and personal. Based on our recent research examining psychological resilience in Olympics champions, in the second section we discuss the five main families of psychological factors (viz. positive personality, motivation, confidence, focus, perceived social support) that protect the best athletes from the potential negative effect of stressors. It is anticipated that this review will help sport psychology researchers examine the interplay between stressors and protective factors, which will, in turn, focus the analytical lens on the processes underlying psychological resilience in athletes.},

These competing claims revolve around the issue of criteria and how they are used to pass judgment on qualitative research. Those involved in sport and exercise sciences need to reflect on this issue with a view to generating further dialogue and a greater understanding of difference within the research community. Method: Two ideal types of researcher, one a criteriologist the other a relativist, are constructed to illustrate how each might judge qualitative studies of different kinds. Results: A comparison of the ways in which the criteriologist and the relativist draw on different assumptions to judge qualitative studies illustrates the constraining nature of the former and the expansive possibilities of the latter. Conclusions: Criteria should be viewed as lists of characterizing traits that are open to reinterpretation as times, conditions, and purposes change. Researchers need to adopt the role of connoisseur in order to pass judgment on different kinds of study in a fair and ethical manner. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@techreport{Duclos,
abstract = {There is still a significant gap between models describing slab avalanche triggering mechanisms and practical field applications in terms of risk prediction and mitigation. The present paper aims at "merging theory and practice", through a simple analysis i) of the basic processes responsible for initiation and expansion of fractured zones, and ii) of how they may be influenced by the various characteristics of the snow cover. Slab avalanche triggering results indeed from four main steps occurring in series: i) nucleation of a collapsed zone in the weak layer, ii) expansion of this collapsed zone, iii) nucleation of a crown fracture, and iv) expansion of this crown fracture, leading to avalanche release. If a single of these steps is missing, avalanche triggering cannot occur. This is why many avalanches are not observed to occur, even if most of triggering criteria seem to be fulfilled. The occurrence of any of these four steps is controlled by simple physical rules, which are described and discussed. More particularly, the 2d step may occur in two very different modes, resulting in either small or very large starting zones. The transition between these two modes is very sensitive to both slab and weak layer properties and to the way skiers choose to cross the slope. Such a strong sensitivity of the expansion mode of the collapsed zone to these parameters is partly responsible for the large variability of avalanche sizes and locations. It accounts for instance for the possible and unpredicted occurrence of huge avalanches at places where much smaller ones are usually observed, or for a sudden release only after several skiers have successively (and safely!) traveled through the area, or for remote triggering events, etc...},

Instead of filling in a single value for each missing value, Rubin's (1987) multiple imputation procedure replaces each missing value with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute. These multiply imputed data sets are then analyzed by using standard procedures for complete data and combining the results from these analyses. No matter which complete-data analysis is used, the process of combining results from different imputed data sets is essentially the same. This results in valid statistical inferences that properly reflect the uncertainty due to missing values. This paper reviews methods for analyzing missing data, including basic concepts and applications of multiple imputation techniques. The paper presents SAS{\textregistered} procedures, PROC MI and PROC MIANALYZE, for creating multiple imputations for incomplete multivariate data and for analyzing results from multiply imputed data sets.},

abstract = {Examined the relationship between perceptions of team cohesiveness and intention for future participation in female sport team athletes, and determined whether type of setting moderated this relationship, in 2 studies. In Study 1, 142 Ss (aged 16–22 yrs) competing on ringette teams in a recreational program were assessed on team cohesiveness using the Group Environment Questionnaire (A. V. Carron et al, 1982). Ss' intent to participate in the future, and perceptions regarding their team's standing were assessed through an interview. As a replication of Study 1, Study 2 assessed team cohesiveness and intent of 124 national ringette team champions (aged 16–22 yrs) on the same measures. In both studies an extreme-groups design was employed. Team cohesiveness related positively to team adherence and intent to participate in future for both recreational and elite Ss. Group integration and social attraction to the group best differentiated the Ss likely to return. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {To place the heuristic-systematic model in its broader context, we begin by considering heuristic and systematic modes of information processing, along with the social-cognitive principles thought to govern the activation and use of stored knowledge. Consistent with the growing emphasis on the role of applicability in determining when stored knowledge will be activated and used in social judgment, we discuss the principle in particular detail. From there we turn to the increasingly critical distinction between conscious and unconscious processes, and discuss how it relates to our distinction between heuristic and systematic processing. We then examine the impact of subjective experiences on judgment, and argue that this reflects the unconscious activation and application of stored heuristics that pertain distinctly to these experiences. Finally, we discuss some of the implications of our conceptualization of subjective experiences for heuristic and systematic processing more broadly.

Moderately active, predominantly Caucasian, participants (male = 33, female = 39, M = 19.18 years, SD =.74) were recruited from the southeastern United States. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: High-efficacy (HE), low-efficacy (LE), or control. Efficacy expectations were manipulated via false performance feedback. During the task participants provided differentiated ratings of perceived effort at 15-s intervals. Effort tolerance was determined by the length of time the participant could maintain the task. Repeated measures (RM) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated the HE group found the task less strenuous and more enjoyable than the LE or control group. Furthermore, the HE group demonstrated greater tolerance of the task than either the LE or control group. These findings imply that self-efficacy has a major role in enhancing performance and physical effort tolerance. Copyright {\textcopyright} Association for Applied Sport Psychology.},

@article{Douma2019,
abstract = {Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of {\textgreater}2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

abstract = {Objective: Although optimism's beneficial role for various life areas is well documented, previous findings regarding its significance for students' achievement at school are inconclusive. This study examined the relation between optimism and academic achievement in early adolescents. It investigated the functional form of this relation, addressed whether the initial achievement level moderates this association, and compared this with effects on self-esteem. Method: We used a large German sample (N56,010; 53.2{\%} females; baseline Mage514.1) with two measurement points over a period of 5 months (middle and end of 7th grade). Estimating LOESS curves and latent change-regression models revealed three main findings. Results: (a) Optimism showed a nonlinear association with subsequent changes in academic achievement: Optimism promoted academic achievement, but this positive association reached a plateau in above-average optimism ranges and a minimum value in below-average ranges of optimism. (b) The achievement level at t1 moderated this relation so that high optimism exerted a more positive effect for high-achieving adolescents. (c) By contrast, optimism had an overall positive effect on self-esteem. Conclusions: The results therefore broaden the evidence on benefits of optimism by linking optimism to academic success in early adolescents but indicate only small and nonlinear associations.

abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods are slowly creeping into all fields of science and are becoming ever more popular in applied research. Although it is very attractive to use Bayesian statistics, our personal experience has led us to believe that naively applying Bayesian methods can be dangerous for at least 3 main reasons: the potential influence of priors, misinterpretation of Bayesian features and results, and improper reporting of Bayesian results. To deal with these 3 points of potential danger, we have developed a succinct checklist: the WAMBS-checklist (When to worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics). The purpose of the questionnaire is to describe 10 main points that should be thoroughly checked when applying Bayesian analysis. We provide an account of " when to worry " for each of these issues related to: (a) issues to check before estimating the model, (b) issues to check after estimating the model but before interpreting results, (c) understanding the influence of priors, and (d) actions to take after interpreting results. To accompany these key points of concern, we will present diagnostic tools that can be used in conjunction with the development and assessment of a Bayesian model. We also include examples of how to interpret results when " problems " in estimation arise, as well as syntax and instructions for implementation. Our aim is to stress the importance of openness and transparency of all aspects of Bayesian estimation, and it is our hope that the WAMBS questionnaire can aid in this process.},

This theory states that two goal orientations manifest themselves in achievement contexts and impact on the motivation process. These two goals have been defined as 'task' and 'ego' goal orientations. This paper traces the development of the Perception of Success Questionnaire as a measure of achievement goals developed specifically for the sport context. The early development of the questionnaire is documented, in which the scale was shortened from the initial 29 to the current 12 question format. We demonstrate that task and ego goals are orthogonal, internal reliabilities for the orientations are high, with strong construct and concurrent validity. We conclude by reporting results from two recent confirmatory factor analyses that were conducted on the Children's and Adult versions of the questionnaire; these results show the Perception of Success Questionnaire to be a reliable and valid instrument to measure achievement goal orientations in sport.},

The DERS has six subscales with five to eight items each (36 total), suggesting multiple questions may assess similar underlying constructs. In an effort to reduce respondent burden and streamline this widely-used instrument, we created a short-form version of the DERS (DERS-SF) using confirmatory factor analysis on data from three adolescent (n = 257) and two adult samples (n = 797). Scores on the DERS-SF yielded similar correlation patterns relative to the full measure, ranging from .90 to .98 and reflecting 81–96 {\%} shared variance.

abstract = {Purpose of Review: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the aggressive coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Recently, investigators have stipulated that COVID-19 patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be subject to poorer outcomes. This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic. Recent Findings: Recent studies from Wuhan cohorts provide valuable information about COVID-19. A cohort with 52 critically ill patients revealed cardiac injury in 12{\%} of patients. Worse outcomes appear to be more prevalent in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway alveolar epithelial cells. Investigators suspect that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the lungs in a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV. Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections. Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB. Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated. Summary: Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses. After an extensive literature review, we conclude that there is no significant evidence to support an association for now, but given the rapid evolvement of this pandemic, findings may change.},

It is shown under what circumstances it is attractive to use Bayesian estimation, and how to interpret properly the results. First, the ingredients underlying Bayesian methods are introduced using a simplified example. Thereafter, the advantages and pitfalls of the specification of prior knowledge are discussed. To illustrate Bayesian methods explained in this study, in a second example a series of studies that examine the theoretical framework of dynamic interactionism are considered. In the Discussion the advantages and disadvantages of using Bayesian statistics are reviewed, and guidelines on how to report on Bayesian statistics are provided.},

Properties of anxiety and depression measures, including the convergent and discriminant validity of self- and clinical ratings, and interrater reliability, are examined in patient and normal samples. Results suggest that anxiety and depression can be reliably and validly assessed; moreover, although these disorders share a substantial component of general affective distress, they can be differentiated on the basis of factors specific to each syndrome. We also review evidence for these specific factors, examining the influence of context and scale content on ratings, factor analytic studies, and the role of low positive affect in depression. With these data, we argue for a tripartite structure consisting of general distress, physiological hyperarousal (specific anxiety), and anhedonia (specific depression), and we propose a diagnosis of mixed anxiety-depression.},

An additional possibility is that overconfidence enhances the person's social status. We tested this status-enhancing account of overconfidence in 6 studies. Studies 1–3 found that overconfidence leads to higher social status in both short- and longer-term groups, using naturalistic and experimental designs. Study 4 applied a Brunswikian lens analysis (Brunswik, 1956) and found that overconfidence leads to a behavioral signature that makes the individual appear competent to others. Studies 5 and 6 measured and experimentally manipulated the desire for status and found that the status motive promotes overconfidence. Together, these studies suggest that people might so often believe they are better than others because it helps them achieve higher social status.},

Using the theory of action phases as the overarching framework to explain how organizations and employees commit to goals and successfully pursue them, in conjunction with self-determination theory to explain the development of goal commitment at the individual level, a motivational model of organizational goal pursuit is proposed. This model takes into consideration mission and strategic goal development, organizational-level implementation intentions in the form of strategic plans and dynamic capabilities, individual goal internalization, and implementation plans at the individual level. These goal phases are proposed to be affected by the attraction, selection, socialization and management of organizational members. The model can serve to develop knowledge in the area of behavioral strategy by integrating motivational considerations into strategic management models.},

Measures of health status and global well-being represent common methods of assessing QOL outcomes, yet little has been done to determine the nature of the relationship of these outcomes with physical activity. Purpose: We examined the roles played by physical activity, health status, and self-efficacy in global QOL (satisfaction with life) in a sample of older Black and White women. Method: Participants (N = 249, M age = 68.12 years) completed multiple indicators of physical activity, self-efficacy, health status, and QOL at baseline of a 24-month prospective trial. Structural equation modeling examined the fit of 3 models of the physical activity and QOL relationship. Results: Analyses indicated that relationships between physical activity and QOL, self-efficacy and QOL were all indirect. Specifically, physical activity influenced self-efficacy and QOL through physical and mental health status, which in turn influenced global QOL. Conclusions: Our findings support a social cognitive model of physical activity's relationship with QOL. Subsequent tests of hypothesized relationships across time are recommended. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The Society of Behavioral Medicine.},

@article{Gilson2006c,
abstract = {Corporate governance scholarship has shifted focus in recent years from hostile takeovers, which occur primarily in the widely held shareholder systems of the United States and the United Kingdom, to the comparative merits of the "controlling shareholder" systems that are the norm most everywhere else in the world. In this emerging debate, the simple dichotomy between controlling shareholder systems and widely held shareholder systems that has largely dominated the discourse is too coarse to allow a deeper understanding of the diversity of ownership structures in different national capital markets and their policy implications. In this Article, Professor Ronald Gilson seeks to complicate the prevailing analysis of controlling shareholders and corporate governance by developing a more nuanced taxonomy of controlling shareholder structures and examining the implications of this view on our understanding of widely held and controlling shareholder systems. Development of a new taxonomy begins with recognition of the controlling shareholder tradeoff: focused monitoring in return for some private benefits of control and at a cost in speed of adaptation. Building from this tradeoff, this Article looks closely at two central features of a more complex taxonomy: the concepts of controlling shareholders and of private benefits of control. In particular, the framework highlights the value of distinguishing between efficient and inefficient controlling shareholder systems, and between pecuniary and nonpecuniary private benefits of control. Together, the two distinctions reframe the taxonomy of shareholder distribution to distinguish between regimes that support companies with a diversity of shareholder distributions and regimes that support only companies with a controlling shareholder. This Article concludes by examining potential macroeconomic effects and policy implications and calling for research under this new framework to further the debate on controlling shareholder systems.},

abstract = {Anxiety and fear are often confounded in discussions of human emotions. However, studies of rodent defensive reactions under naturalistic conditions suggest anxiety is functionally distinct from fear. Unambiguous threats, such as predators, elicit flight from rodents (if an escape-route is available), whereas ambiguous threats (e.g., the odor of a predator) elicit risk assessment behavior, which is associated with anxiety as it is preferentially modulated by anti-anxiety drugs. However, without human evidence, it would be premature to assume that rodent-based psychological models are valid for humans. We tested the human validity of the risk assessment explanation for anxiety by presenting 8 volunteers with emotive scenarios and asking them to pose facial expressions. Photographs and videos of these expressions were shown to 40 participants who matched them to the scenarios and labeled each expression. Scenarios describing ambiguous threats were preferentially matched to the facial expression posed in response to the same scenario type. This expression consisted of two plausible environmental-scanning behaviors (eye darts and head swivels) and was labeled as anxiety, not fear. The facial expression elicited by unambiguous threat scenarios was labeled as fear. The emotion labels generated were then presented to another 18 participants who matched them back to photographs of the facial expressions. This back-matching of labels to faces also linked anxiety to the environmental-scanning face rather than fear face. Results therefore suggest that anxiety produces a distinct facial expression and that it has adaptive value in situations that are ambiguously threatening, supporting a functional, risk-assessing explanation for human anxiety.},

In an international sample of 454 respondents, results showed that RST, psychopathic personality, and callous-unemotional measures accounted for different aspects of risk-taking behaviour. Specifically, traits associated with ‘fearlessness' related more to ‘prosocial' (recreational and social) risk-taking, whilst traits associated with ‘impulsivity' related more to ‘antisocial' (ethical and health) risk-taking. Further, we demonstrate that psychopathic personality may be demonstrated by combining the RST and callous-unemotional traits (high impulsivity, callousness, and low fear). Overall this study showed how impulsive, fearless and antisocial traits can be used in combination to identify pro- and anti-social risk-taking behaviours; suggestions for future research are indicated.},

abstract = {Resilience is typically conceptualized as successful adaptation to serious negative life events. Even relatively mundane stressors, however, require coping. Therefore, we argue that resilience should reflect managing well with stressors in general. To support the argument that resilience is relevant for social psychology and that social psychology can inform our understanding of resilience, we first discuss a program of research that links prior life adversity exposure to resilience to everyday stressors. We next review a psychophysiological approach—the biopsychosocial model of challenge/threat—to assessing resilience as it occurs and tie this approach to research on coping resources. Finally, we highlight two central research areas within social psychology—romantic relationships and stigma and prejudice—for which resilience is highly relevant. This demonstrates the merits of applying the concept of resilience to a range of stressors and the potential for experimental social psychology to inform understudied aspects of resilience.},

abstract = {Background: Many alcohol research questions require methods that take a person-centered approach because the interest is in finding heterogeneous groups of individuals, such as those who are susceptible to alcohol dependence and those who are not. A person-centered focus also is useful with longitudinal data to represent heterogeneity in developmental trajectories. In alcohol, drug, and mental health research the recognition of heterogeneity has led to theories of multiple developmental pathways. Methods: This paper gives a brief overview of new methods that integrate variable- and person- centered analyses. Methods discussed include latent class analysis, latent transition analysis, latent class growth analysis, growth mixture modeling, and general growth mixture modeling. These methods are presented in a general latent variable modeling framework that expands traditional latent variable modeling by including not only continuous latent variables but also categorical latent variables. Results: Four examples that use the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data are presented to illustrate latent class analysis, latent class growth analysis, growth mixture modeling, and general growth mixture modeling. Latent class analysis of antisocial behavior found four classes. Four heavy drinking trajectory classes were found. The relationship between the latent classes and background variables and consequences was studied. Conclusions: Person-centered and variable-centered analyses typically have been seen as different activities that use different types of models and software. This paper gives a brief overview of new methods that integrate variable- and person-centered analyses. The general framework makes it possible to combine these models and to study new models serving as a stimulus for asking research questions that have both person- and variable-centered aspects.},

abstract = {We develop a new version of prospect theory that employs cumulative rather than separable decision weights and extends the theory in several respects. This version, called cumulative prospect theory, applies to uncertain as well as to risky prospects with any number of outcomes, and it allows different weighting functions for gains and for losses. Two principles, diminishing sensitivity and loss aversion, are invoked to explain the characteris-tic curvature of the value function and the weighting functions. A review of the experimental evidence and the results of a new experiment confirm a distinctive fourfold pattern of risk attitudes: risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses of high probability; risk seeking for gains and risk aversion for losses of low probability. Expected utility theory reigned for several decades as the dominant normative and descriptive model of decision making under uncertainty, but it has come under serious question in recent years. There is now general agreement that the theory does not provide an adequate description of individual choice: a substantial body of evidence shows that decision makers systematically violate its basic tenets. Many alternative mod-els have been proposed in response to this empirical challenge (for reviews, see Camerer, 1989; Fishburn, 1988; Machina, 1987). Some time ago we presented a model of choice, called prospect theory, which explained the major violations of expected utility theory in choices between risky prospects with a small number of outcomes (Kahneman and Tver-sky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, 1986). The key elements of this theory are 1) a value function that is concave for gains, convex for losses, and steeper for losses than for gains,},

abstract = {In recent years, the value of social learning approaches as part of the design and delivery of formalised coach development initiatives has gained credence in the literature. However, insight is currently lacking into the fundamental social dimensions that underpin coach learning. Accordingly, this study aimed to explore coaches' perceptions of their actual and preferred methods of acquiring new coaching knowledge, the types of knowledge they currently acquire and/or desire, and their application of new knowledge. Responses to an online survey, completed by practicing coaches (N = 320) in a range of sports and contexts, were analysed descriptively and inductively. Results revealed that coaches' preferred, and mostly acquired, coaching knowledge from informal learning activities, especially when these permitted social interaction. Notably, however, formal coach education courses were also reported relatively frequently as a source of recent knowledge acquisition. Nevertheless, critical justification for and application of, acquired knowledge was largely absent. Based on the findings, we suggest that, before social learning activities such as mentoring schemes and communities of practice are placed at the centre of formalised coach development provision, coach educators must put in place the support structures to better enable coaches to recognise and deal with the potentially mixed influences of the social milieu on coach learning, aiming to ensure that their informal development is sufficiently open-minded, reflective and critical.},

By systematically varying the levels of theoretically important vignette characteristics a large population of different vignettes is typically available – too large to be presented to each respondent. Therefore, each respondent gets only a subset of vignettes. These subsets may either be randomly selected in following the tradition of the factorial survey or systematically selected according to an experimental design. We show that these strategies in selecting vignette sets have strong implications for the analysis and interpretation of vignette data. Random selection strategies result in a random confounding of effects and heavily rely on the assumption of no interaction effects. In contrast, experimental strategies systematically confound interaction effects with main or set effects, thereby preserving a meaningful interpretation of main and important interaction effects. Using a pilot study on attitudes toward immigrants we demonstrate the implementation and analysis of a confounded factorial design.},

abstract = {The authors examined contextual dynamics and individual differences as moderators of the relationship between goal-performance discrepancies and time allocation among competing demands. As hypothesized, a complex 3-way interaction was observed among environmental volatility, relative progress, and time on resource allocation. When goal progress was determined only by the performers' actions (low environmental volatility), greater time was allocated to the least discrepant goal early on and to the most discrepant goal toward the end of available time. In contrast, when goal progress was also influenced by unpredictable external factors (high environmental volatility), greater time was allocated to the most discrepant goal early on and to the least discrepant goal as the deadline neared. Individual differences in goal orientation further influenced this relationship within a volatile context, with these relationships also varying across time. Under such conditions, those with a strong mastery orientation allocated more time to toward the most discrepant task, whereas those with a strong avoidance orientation allocated more time to the goal closest to being attained. The implications for theory and research on dynamic time allocation are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

This concept of needs leads to the hypotheses that different regulatoryprocesses underlying goalpursuits are differentially associ- ated with effective functioning and well-being and also that different goal contents have different relations to the quality of behavior and mental health, specifically because different regulatory processes and different goal contents are associated with differing degrees of need satisfaction. Social contexts and individual differences that support satisfaction of the basic needs facilitate natural growth processes including intrinsically motivated behavior and integration of extrinsic motivations, whereas those thatforestall autonomy, competence, or relatedness are associated with poorer motivation, performance, and well-being. We also discuss the relation of the psychological needs to cultural values, evolutionary processes, and other contemporary mo- tivation theories.},

Finally, a study with 77 psychiatric patients shows that self-oriented, other-oriented, and socially prescribed perfectionism relate differentially to indices of personality disorders and other psychological maladjustment.

abstract = {This article reviews the main insights from selected literature on risk perception, particularly in connection with natural hazards. It includes numerous case studies on perception and social behavior dealing with floods, droughts, earthquakes, volcano eruptions, wild fires, and landslides. The review reveals that personal experience of a natural hazard and trust--or lack of trust--in authorities and experts have the most substantial impact on risk perception. Cultural and individual factors such as media coverage, age, gender, education, income, social status, and others do not play such an important role but act as mediators or amplifiers of the main causal connections between experience, trust, perception, and preparedness to take protective actions. When analyzing the factors of experience and trust on risk perception and on the likeliness of individuals to take preparedness action, the review found that a risk perception paradox exists in that it is assumed that high risk perception will lead to personal preparedness and, in the next step, to risk mitigation behavior. However, this is not necessarily true. In fact, the opposite can occur if individuals with high risk perception still choose not to personally prepare themselves in the face of a natural hazard. Therefore, based on the results of the review, this article offers three explanations suggesting why this paradox might occur. These findings have implications for future risk governance and communication as well as for the willingness of individuals to invest in risk preparedness or risk mitigation actions.},

When comparing the differences between the two types of resiliency, a stronger negative relationship with Neuroticism, and stronger positive relationships with Openness and Agreeableness were obtained with ego-resiliency, compared with trait resilience. However, there was a lack of homogeneity in effect sizes across studies especially for ego-resilience.

abstract = {Every year a large number of backcountry recreationists are caught in avalanches and statistics show the majority of avalanches that catch people are actually triggered by people. With the increasing popularity of winter recreational sports, it is safe to assume that backcountry recreationists will continue to travel into avalanche-prone terrain. To prevent further increases in avalanche accidents it is important to know if there are any factors that influence a recreationist's likelihood of being involved in an avalanche. A web-based survey was used to investigate this problem, using a number of research hypotheses as the framework for the survey questions. Based on patterns found in background research of victim statistics and trends in avalanche education, these hypotheses focused on variables including age, gender, avalanche education, frequency in the backcountry, travel method, group dynamics, preparedness and extreme adventure goals. Over 1400 people responded to this survey and represented a diverse group. Respondents were from all over the world, different age groups, different levels of avalanche training and used all different travel methods. Some 90{\%} of the respondents were male but in other respects the survey appears to accurately reflect the diversity of backcountry recreationists. 448 of the respondents have witnessed or been involved in avalanche accidents, some more than once. The analysis of the research hypotheses revealed that all variables were associated with avalanche involvement and some interesting patterns were discovered. Those participants that had the most avalanche training and were the most prepared were involved in more avalanches. This is very important as avalanche education and preparedness are intended to minimize risk. Those with intermediate levels of group dynamics and with extreme adventure goals were also involved in more avalanches. Not all of the factors associated with involvement can be changed, but those that can, such as avalanche training, preparedness and group dynamics, can be influenced through avalanche education. Avalanche education remains the most important tool for mitigating avalanche accidents. Further research in this area can help to effectively hone avalanche education to help prevent accidents.},

abstract = {According to the two-factor theory of perfectionism (Stoeber {\&} Otto, 2006), perfectionism comprises two super-ordinate dimensions—perfectionistic strivings (PS) and perfectionistic concerns (PC)—that show different, and often opposite, relations with psychological adjustment and maladjustment, particularly when their overlap is partialled out. Recently, Hill (2014) raised concerns about the interpretation of the relations that PS show after partialling. The present article aims to alleviate these concerns. First, we address the concern that partialling changes the conceptual meaning of PS. Second, we explain how the relations of residual PS (i.e., PS with PC partialled out) differ from those of PS, and how to interpret these differences. In this, we also discuss suppressor effects and how mutual suppression affects the relations of both PS and PC with outcomes. Furthermore, we pro-vide recommendations of how to report and interpret findings of analyses partialling out the effects of PS and PC. We conclude that, if properly understood and reported, there is nothing to be concerned about when partialling PS and PC. On the contrary, partialling is essential if we want to understand the shared, unique, combined, and interactive relations of the different dimensions of perfectionism.},

abstract = {Purpose. A meta-analysis of studies integrating the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and self-determination theory (SDT) in health contexts is presented. The analysis aimed to provide cumulative empirical support for a motivational sequence in which self-determined motivation from SDT predicts the proximal predictors of intentions and behaviour from the TPB. Methods. A literature search identified 36 integrated studies providing 45 tests of effects between TPB and SDT variables. Hunter and Schmidt's (1994) methods of metaanalysis were used to correct the effect sizes across the studies for statistical artifacts. Age (old versus young), publication status (published versus unpublished), study design (correlational versus experimental/ intervention), and behaviour type (physical activity versus other health-related behaviours) were evaluated as moderators of the effects. A path-analysis using the meta-analytically derived correlations was conducted to examine the proposed motivational sequence. Results. Statistically significant corrected correlations were evident among the perceived autonomy support and self-determined motivation constructs from SDT and the attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, intention, and healthrelated behaviour constructs from the TPB. Only six of the 28 effect sizes were moderated by the proposed moderators. Path analysis revealed that the significant effects of self-determined motivation on intentions and behaviour were partially mediated by the proximal predictors from the TPB. Conclusions. Evidence from this synthesis supported the theoretical integration and proposed motivational sequence. Results are discussed with reference to the complementary aspects of the TPB and SDTand the need for integrated experimental or intervention studies on a broader range of health behaviours. {\textcopyright} 2009 The British Psychological Society.},

Despite this, research into the practical application of data analytics to the development of health policy is still limited. In this study we examine how data science and machine learning methods can be applied to a variety of open health datasets, including GP prescribing data, disease prevalence data and economic deprivation data. This paper discusses the context of mental health and antidepressant prescribing in Northern Ireland and highlights its importance as a public policy issue. A hypothesis is proposed, suggesting that the link between antidepressant usage and economic deprivation is mediated by depression prevalence. An analysis of various heterogeneous open datasets is used to test this hypothesis. A description of the methodology is provided, including the open health datasets under investigation and an explanation of the data processing pipeline. Correlations between key variables and several different clustering analyses are presented. Evidence is provided which suggests that the depression prevalence hypothesis is flawed. Clusters of GP practices based on prescribing behaviour and disease prevalence are described and key characteristics are identified and discussed. Possible policy implications are explored and opportunities for future research are identified.},

@article{Maul2017,
abstract = {It is commonly believed that self-report, survey-based instruments can be used to measure a wide range of psychological attributes, such as self-control, growth mindsets, and grit. Increasingly, such instruments are being used not only for basic research but also for supporting decisions regarding educational policy and accountability. The validity of such instruments is typically investigated using a classic set of methods, including the exam-ination of reliability coefficients, factor or principal components analyses, and correlations between scores on the instrument and other variables. However, these techniques may fall short of providing the kinds of rigorous, potentially falsifying tests of relevant hypotheses commonly expected in scientific research. This point is illustrated via a series of studies in which respondents were presented with survey items deliberately constructed to be uninterpretable, but the application of the aforementioned validation procedures nonetheless returned favorable-appearing results. In part, this disconnect may be traceable to the way in which operationalist modes of thinking in the social sciences have reinforced the perception that attri-butes do not need to be defined independently of particular sets of testing operations. It is argued that affairs might be improved via greater attention to the manner in which definitions of psychological attributes are articu-lated and greater openness to treating beliefs about the existence and measurability of psychological attributes as hypotheses rather than assump-tions—in other words, as beliefs potentially subject to revision.},

abstract = {Clustered overdispersed multivariate count data are challenging to model due to the presence of correlation within and between samples. Typically, the first source of correlation needs to be addressed but its quantification is of less interest. Here, we focus on the correlation between time points. In addition, the effects of covariates on the multivariate counts distribution need to be assessed. To fulfill these requirements, a regression model based on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution for association between covariates and the categorical counts is extended by using random effects to deal with the additional clustering. This model is the Dirichlet-multinomial mixed regression model. Alternatively, a negative binomial regression mixed model can be deployed where the corresponding likelihood is conditioned on the total count. It appears that these two approaches are equivalent when the total count is fixed and independent of the random effects. We consider both subject-specific and categorical-specific random effects. However, the latter has a larger computational burden when the number of categories increases. Our work is motivated by microbiome data sets obtained by sequencing of the amplicon of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. These data have a compositional structure and are typically overdispersed. The microbiome data set is from an epidemiological study carried out in a helminth-endemic area in Indonesia. The conclusions are as follows: time has no statistically significant effect on microbiome composition, the correlation between subjects is statistically significant, and treatment has a significant effect on the microbiome composition only in infected subjects who remained infected.},

abstract = {Articles H umans and their societies depend on natural systems for a wide range of services that are essential for their well-being. For most of human history, these services have been readily available. It is little surprise, then, that present-day societies tend to take many of these natural services for granted (Daily 1997, Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005a, 2006a, 2006b, 2006c, 2006d, 2006e), even while the support systems that provide the services are being severely degraded (Vitousek et al. 1997, Lubchenco 1998). Fish-eries and other resource systems have declined drastically (Pauly et al. 1998, 2002, Myers and Worm 2003, Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2006f, 2006g, Worm et al. 2006) as a result of overfishing, bycatch, habitat destruction, nutrient and chemical pollution, and selective fishing on apex predators; oceans are warming and becoming more acidic (Orr et al. 2005, Royal Society 2005); and novel and reemergent diseases and other invading species have burgeoned as problems (Ward and Lafferty 2004). In the face of these growing challenges to the abilities of human societies to achieve and maintain meaningful and productive lifestyles, we must direct attention to issues of sustainability. For ecosystem services to be sustained over time, the ecosystems providing them must be able to continue functioning in essential ways despite disruptions. In other words, they must be robust and resilient, concepts that have developed somewhat independently in diverse scientific communities to mean much the same thing: the capacity of systems to keep functioning even when disturbed. For the purposes of this article, the central question is this: how do we increase the robustness or resilience of the systems that provide critical ecosystem services, while overcoming the robustness or resilience of systems that yield undesirable phenomena? Given the century-long history of theory on the dynam-ics of ecological systems (going back at least to the work of the great mathematician Vito Volterra) and the practice of managing those systems, we can pose two critical questions: (1) Why has management not been more successful? and (2) Why are we still uncertain about how best to manage crises arising from the magnitude of human impacts on our envi-ronment? The central problem is that both natural and socio -economic systems are complex: they are characterized by multiple possible outcomes and by the potential for rapid change and major regime shifts due to slower and smaller changes in exogenous or endogenous influences (Levin 1999,},

Moreover, cross-cultural experiments often fail to distinguish between placement and precision and worse still, often compare population-mean placement estimates rather than individual performance subtracted from placement. Here we introduce a new method for concurrently capturing both placement and precision at an individual level based on individual performance: The Elicitation of Genuine Overconfidence (EGO) method. We conducted experiments using the EGO method, manipulating domain, task knowledge, and incentives across four populations—Japanese, Hong Kong Chinese, Euro Canadians, and East Asian Canadians. We find that previous measures of population-level overconfidence may have been misleading; rather than universal, overconfidence is highly context dependent. Our results reveal cross-cultural differences in sensitivity to incentives and differences in overconfidence strategies, with underconfidence, accuracy, and overconfidence. Comparing sexes, we find inconsistent results for overplacement, but that males are consistently more confident in their placement. These findings have implications for our understanding of the adaptive value of overconfidence and its role in explaining population-level and individual-level differences in economic and psychological behavior.},

abstract = {Missing data are ubiquitous in clinical epidemiological research. Individuals with missing data may differ from those with no missing data in terms of the outcome of interest and prognosis in general. Missing data are often categorized into the following three types: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). In clinical epidemiological research, missing data are seldom MCAR. Missing data can constitute considerable challenges in the analyses and interpretation of results and can potentially weaken the validity of results and conclusions. A number of methods have been developed for dealing with missing data. These include complete-case analyses, missing indicator method, single value imputation, and sensitivity analyses incorporating worst-case and best-case scenarios. If applied under the MCAR assumption, some of these methods can provide unbiased but often less precise estimates. Multiple imputation is an alternative method to deal with missing data, which accounts for the uncertainty associated with missing data. Multiple imputation is implemented in most statistical software under the MAR assumption and provides unbiased and valid estimates of associations based on information from the available data. The method affects not only the coefficient estimates for variables with missing data but also the estimates for other variables with no missing data.},

abstract = {Relative to recreationists, avalanche professionals in Canada have a high success rate for managing avalanche hazard and making sound decisions in avalanche terrain. This success invites the question: What can be learned from these successes relative to avalanche education, decision support and accident prevention for backcountry recreationists? I surveyed Canadian avalanche professionals using a mail-in questionnaire on core knowledge and skills for sound avalanche decision making, key areas of education that can improve avalanche decision making, effective methods to communicate avalanche hazard, and the potential of a recreational decision support framework to improve decision- making and result in fewer recreational avalanche accidents and fatalities. Respondents identified human factors and choice of terrain as the primary causes of recreational avalanche accidents and recommended that recreational education targeted in these two areas would effectively reduce avalanche accidents. Three meta-themes emerged to support sound decisions by recreationists; training and education, hazard communication and decision support. In this paper, I examine the results of this survey within the context of theories of adult learning and decision science. I offer an analysis of why it is important to look at avalanche accident prevention from a human sciences research perspective and propose a systemic approach to supporting sound recreational decision-making. Based upon these survey results, I advocate strong support for the implementation of a recreational decision support framework in Canada, although there were several complexities identified by survey respondents. It is clear that the integration of expertise from a wide range of disciplines will be required to design and implement an effective and integrated framework that will support sound decisions and reduce the number of avalanche accidents and fatalities in Canada.},

Regression analyses revealed that the effect of performance or mastery-focused goals on intrinsic motivation varied as a function of achievement orientation. Specifically, the provision of task-specific standards with a performance focus enhanced intrinsic motivation for achievement-oriented individuals, whereas the assignment of such goals proved deleterious to the intrinsic motivation of those low in achievement orientation. Individuals low in achievement orientation displayed the highest levels of intrinsic motivation when provided with mastery-focused goals. A similar pattern of effects was obtained on competence valuation and task involvement, both of which were additionally validated as mediators of the direct effects on intrinsic motivation.},

abstract = {Objectives: Although the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS), published in 1995, has demonstrated validity and reliability in multiple studies, the scale has received some criticisms leading to revisions herein described. The objective of the present studies was to examine the construct validity and reliability of a revised scale sport motivation scale (SMS-II). Design: Two studies were conducted using distinct samples of athletes. Study 1 examined adult athletes participating in a variety of sports and Study 2 examined youth basketball players and swimmers. Method: In Study 1 the SMS-II was introduced and featured various item content changes, a reduced number of items per subscale, the addition of an integrated regulation subscale, and the introduction of a single intrinsic motivation subscale to replace the three intrinsic motivation subscales in the SMS. Relations of SMS-II subscales with each other and with expected outcomes supported the new scale's validity. In Study 2, the structure of the SMS-II and its relations with outcomes were further examined. Results: Results of factor analyses, tests for internal consistency, and correlations among the different subscales and between the subscales and several outcomes of interest, supported the validity of the SMS-II. Conclusions: Discussion focuses on the need for measurement improvement, and potential future directions for SMS-II research. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The fundamental idea is that motor tasks represent different challenges for performers of different abilities.

abstract = {Although psychologists have long been concerned to distinguish rational from nonrational elements in thought processes, surprisingly little attention has been paid to this issue in the study of selective exposure and reactions to expectancy disconfirmation. The present study explored directly how much information subjects sought and how they revised their expectancies when receiving clues that an outcome, either expected or unexpected, positive or negative, had occurred, Revisions were compared to the rational revisions prescribed by a Bayesian model of probabilistic inference. The subjects were 105 students who volunteered to learn their actual course grades in an experiment. Subjects receiving discrepant outcomes were actually more rational in revising their opinions according to a Bayesian model, and in addition tended to seek more information. Following exposure, however, subjects receiving discrepant outcomes were more tense and uncertain about their outcome. It is suggested that in general discrepant information arouses conflicting adeptive tendencies: its informational value and subjects' curiosity move them to explore and make use of it, while at the same dissonance and suspicion move them to reject it.},

Individuals who engage in SM are invariably positioned as experiencing intra-psychic conflict ameliorated through the displacement of the sexual drive. This is a limited and one-dimensional analysis of a complex phenomenon. This article presents the results of an in-depth qualitative study designed to further our understanding of the psychology of SM consistent with a social constructionist approach. Twenty-four self-identified sadomasochists, recruited through SM clubs and agencies and informal social networks, were interviewed. Thematic discourse analysis was used to generate a four-factor definition of SM: Consensuality, an unequable balance of power, sexual arousal and compatibility of definition. Participants positioned SM variously as dissidence, as pleasure, as escapism, as transcendence, as learned behaviour, as intra-psychic, as pathological and as ‘inexplicable'. The research findings, their relevance to our understanding of SM sexualities and the limitations of the methodology and subsequent formulation, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2001, SAGE Publications.

The scale focused on self-serving behaviours which might directly or indirectly harm the interests of others. Data were obtained from 108 drivers taking part in a research programme examining a range of factors underlying traffic accident risk. Apart from social deviance scores, measures were taken of Type-A behaviour pattern, decision-making style, self-reported driving style, age, sex, annual mileage, and accidents over a three-year period. The results indicated that the social deviance scale yielded a good spread of values and had adequate intra-scale reliability. Social deviance was positively correlated with accident rates independently of age, sex and annual mileage. The association between social deviance and accident rates appeared to be partly mediated by faster driving speed. The results indicate that, even within the general population, social deviance can show measurable variation and that this variation is predictive of traffic accident risk.},

Conscientiousness and goal-setting each independently predicted quality of preparation, goal-setting moderated the relationship between extraversion and distractibility, and emotional stability and emotional control largely independently predicted coping with adversity. The results suggest that athletes' personalities and performance strategies should both be considered when attempting to maximize training effectiveness and that performance strategies are sometimes more effective for some people than for others.},

We describe two major types of EVM aimed at assessing explicit (i.e., paper people studies) and implicit (i.e., policy capturing and conjoint analysis) processes and outcomes. We offer best practice recommendations regarding the design and implementation of EVM studies based on a multidisciplinary literature review, discuss substantive domains and topics that can benefit from implementing EVM, address knowledge gaps regarding EVM such as the need to increase realism and the number and diversity of participants, and address ways to overcome some of the negative perceptions about EVM by pointing to exemplary articles that have used EVM successfully.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical vignettes offer an inexpensive and convenient alternative to the benchmark method of chart audits for assessing quality of care. We examined whether vignettes accurately measure and predict variation in the quality of preventive care.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: We developed scoring criteria based on national guidelines for 11 prevention items, categorized as vaccine, vascular-related, cancer screening, and personal behaviors. Three measurement methods were used to ascertain the quality of care provided by clinicians seeing trained actors (standardized patients; SPs) presenting with common outpatient conditions: 1) the abstracted medical record from an SP visit; 2) SP reports of physician practice during those visits; and 3) physician responses to matching computerized case scenarios (clinical vignettes).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSETTING: Three university-affiliated (including 2 VA) and one community general internal medicine clinics.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-one randomly selected physicians from among eligible general internal medicine residents and attending physicians.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physicians saw 480 SPs (120 at each site) and completed 480 vignettes. We calculated the proportion of prevention items for each visit reported or recorded by the 3 measurement methods. We developed a multiple regression model to determine whether site, training level, or clinical condition predicted prevention performance for each measurement method. We found that overall prevention scores ranged from 57{\%} (SP) to 54{\%} (vignettes) to 46{\%} (chart abstraction). Vignettes matched or exceeded SP scores for 3 prevention categories (vaccine, vascular-related, and personal behavior). Prevention quality varied by site (from 40{\%} to 67{\%}) and was predicted similarly by vignettes and SPs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Vignettes can measure and predict prevention performance. Vignettes may be a less costly way to assess prevention performance that also controls for patient case-mix.},

abstract = {Behavior change interventions are effective to the extent that they affect appropriately-measured outcomes, especially in experimental controlled trials. The primary goal of this study was to analyze the impact of a 1-year weight management intervention based on selfdetermination theory (SDT) on theory-based psychosocial mediators, physical activity/exercise, and body weight and composition. Participants were 239 women (37.6 ± 7.1 years; 31.5 ± 4.1 kg/m2) who received either an intervention focused on promoting autonomous forms of exercise regulation and intrinsic motivation, or a general health education program (controls). At 12 months, the intervention group showed increased weight loss (-7.29{\%},) and higher levels of physical activity/exercise (+138 ± 26 min/ day of moderate plus vigorous exercise; +2,049 ± 571 steps/day), compared to controls (P{\textless}0.001). Main intervention targets such as more autonomous self-regulation (for treatment and for exercise) and a more autonomous perceived treatment climate revealed large effect sizes (between 0.80 and .96), favoring intervention (P{\textless}0.001). Results suggest that interventions grounded in SDT can be successfully implemented in the context of weight management, enhancing the internalization of more autonomous forms of behavioral regulation, and facilitating exercise adherence, while producing clinically-significant weight reduction, when compared to a control condition. Findings are fully consistent with previous studies conducted within this theoretical framework in other areas of health behavior change. {\textcopyright}Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.},

abstract = {Self-determination theory is a broad and widely applied theory of motivation, personality development, and wellness. The theory began with a narrow focus on intrinsic motivation but has expanded over time to encompass both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and spawned new perspectives on well-being, life-goals, relationship quality, vitality and depletion, and eudaimonia, among other topics. In this overview of SDT, we first discuss the value of broad theory for psychological science. We then describe the strategy behind SDT's development, and the unfolding of its core mini-theories and topical models, from early studies on intrinsic motivation to the enormous body of research being produced today by a global community of SDT scholars. Throughout we highlight evidence for the critical role of supports for autonomy, competence and relatedness in human development and thriving, and the strong practical and translational value of a functionally-focused, and empirically-supported, theoretical framework.},

abstract = {The authors draw on two families of theories – developmental networks and sociocultural perspectives on learning – to develop an interdisciplinary approach to the study of doctoral education as a path to the professoriate. This approach seeks to elucidate the connection between doctoral students' developmental networks, what they learn during their graduate experience (including their learning about the faculty role) and how they develop a professional identity. The authors first discuss the key tenets of the developmental networks and sociocultural perspectives, before exploring their alignments and explaining how the combination might remedy the limitations inherent in each approach. Finally, they offer some research propositions and directions for further study of the preparation of doctoral students for academic careers. For decades, the doctoral degree has been regarded as the route to an academic career. Although the numbers of individuals seeking doctoral degrees have increased in recent decades, and the degree is now viewed as preparation for a variety of careers in addition to university teaching and research, the PhD is still required for most academic posts (a notable exception is the for-profit higher education sector). While the purposes of doctoral education are widely debated, the need to better understand how doctoral programs shape teachers and researchers remains a key concern. Research shows that graduate programs do not always prepare students well for the realities they face once they earn faculty appointments (Austin 2002; Nyquist and Wulff 2003). In the United States, concerns about the effectiveness of doctoral programs in meeting students' needs spurred several high-profile initiatives aimed at improving graduate education, including the Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate (supported by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching), the PhD Completion Project (sponsored by the Council of Graduate Schools), and the Preparing Future Faculty Program (supported by the Council of Graduate Schools and the Association of American Colleges and Universities). In the UK, the Roberts Review (2002) similarly questioned the adequacy of train-ing of doctoral students for posts as university teachers. Huisman, de Weert, and Bartelse (2002) broadened the target, arguing that 'European countries must carefully scrutinize the pre-and early career stages of potential faculty members and make},

abstract = {The most widely used multivariate statistical models in the social and behavioral sciences involve linear structural relations among observed and latent variables. In practice, these variables are generally nonnormally distributed; hence classical multivariate analysis, based on multinomial error-free variables having no simultaneous interrelations, is not adequate to deal with such data. A promising alternative, based on asymptotically distribution-free (ADF) covariance structure analysis, has been found to be virtually useless in practical model evaluation at finite sample sizes with nonnormal data. We take a new look at the basic statistical theory of structural models under arbitrary distributions, using the methodology of nonlinear regression and generalized least squares estimation. For example, we adopt the use of residual weight matrices from regression theory. We develop a series of estimators and tests based on arbitrary distribution theory. We obtain a type of probabilistic Bartlett correction for various test statistics that can be simply applied in practice. A small simulation study replicates the extremely inadequate performance of one of our own and the original ADF model tests. In contrast, our corrected statistics have approximately correct means at all sample sizes, though their variances tend to be too low at the smallest sample sizes, leading to some “overacceptance” of the true model. {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

A Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ) was developed to measure external, introjected, identified, intrinsic and amotivated forms of regulation for exercise behaviour. 298 sports centre attendees completed the questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the existence of this gradient of autonomy in exercise behaviour regulation but high levels of skewness in the amotivation items indicated that amotivated regulation was not relevant for this sample. A four factor model with amotivation eliminated demonstrated acceptable discriminant validity and internal consistency. A second study confirmed the factor structure and internal consistency of the measure. Multisample analysis established factorial invariance across gender. Subscale intercorrelations approxi- mated a simplex pattern, characteristic of an underlying continuum. The BREQ may allow finer analysis of the motivational forces at play in exercise adoption and maintenance situations.},

All versions of this article have been corrected.] The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a mental toughness intervention delivered to a group of elite youth cricketers. The central feature of the intervention was repeated exposure to punishment-conditioned stimuli in the training environment. To avoid the potentially harmful effects of punishment, the intervention was designed and delivered in a multidisciplinary transformational manner, and participants were taught a variety of coping strategies to deal with the threatening environment. A mixed model (group × time) design was used to compare the intervention group against a comparison control group on various markers of mental toughness over time. Generally speaking, the intervention group demonstrated significant improvements in mental toughness in comparison with the control group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretically derived mental toughness intervention that has shown meaningful effects that can be differentiated from general psychological skills training effects. Theoretical implications are discussed in the context of systematic desensitization training (Wolpe, 1958), and applied recommendations are offered in relation to the intelligent use of punishment in athletic training environments.

abstract = {This paper is a confessional tale that focuses on challenges encountered during the process of conducting member reflections, and on the lessons learned from these. Recent discussions on enhancing the rigor of qualitative research conducted from an interpretivist stance encourage the use of member reflections, rather than the previously widely adopted member checking. Yet, practical examples of how to use this technique are scarce in the sport, exercise and health literature. As a consequence, researchers trying to achieve rigor in their work might struggle, especially if inexperienced. In this work, the first author provides a personal narrative that explores the questions and doubts encountered when engaging with member reflections during her PhD degree. Drawing on the first author's reflective journal, a challenging situation is portrayed, and recommendations for other neophyte researchers are forwarded through four main lessons learned: (a) lessons on rigor in qualitative research, (b) lessons on tellability and layers of understanding, (c) lessons on the importance of confrontations and knowledge exchange, and (d) lessons on relational ethics.},

It was hypothesised that motives influence exercise participation by influencing behavioural regulation, and that motives are themselves influenced by personality traits. Data were from a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 252 office workers, mean age 40 years. Analysis was by structural equation modelling. According to the final model, appearance/weight motive increased external regulation, thereby reducing participation, and also increased introjected regulation. Health/fitness motive increased identified regulation, thereby increasing participation. Social engagement motive increased intrinsic regulation. Neuroticism increased appearance/weight motive, openness increased health/fitness motive, and conscientiousness, without affecting motives, reduced external and introjected regulation. It is inferred that exercise promotion programmes, without denigrating appearance/weight motive, should encourage other motives more conducive to autonomous motivation.},

abstract = {In economic theories it is assumed that risk aversion is a typical human attitude toward risk, and differences are determined by the curvature of the utility function. The results of psychological studies have indicated, however, that people differ in how they make financial decisions under uncertainty and what motivates them to take economic risks. This paper introduces two kinds of risk taking, instrumental risk taking and stimulating risk taking, and reports their empirical examination in two studies. The purpose of these studies was to test the reliability and validity of the Stimulating–Instrumental Risk Inventory—a method used to measure the two risk taking tendencies. It was found that instrumental risk taking is related to risk preference in the investment domain and is determined by personality traits connected with orientation toward the future, the tendency to think rationally, impulsivity, and sensation seeking. Stimulating risk taking was found to be related to the preference for recreational, ethical, health, and gambling risks and was associated with personality features connected with paratelic orientation, arousal seeking, impulsivity, and strong sensation seeking.},

@article{Mishra2011,
abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated that various forms of risky behavior are highly associated among individuals, and such personality traits as impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and low self-control are correlated with risk-taking. However, little evidence indicates that self-report measures of personality traits associated with risky behavior significantly correlate with a behavioral preference for risk. We examined whether personality questionnaire measures of traits associated with risk (impulsivity, sensation-seeking, low self-control) were correlated with various behavioral measures of risk (future discounting, probabilistic risky choice). We show that measures of risk-propensity comprise three principal components: Future Discounting, Risky Personality, and Variance Preference. Risky Personality and Variance Preference were significantly correlated. Future Discounting was not associated with either of the other risk components. Together, the results provide some evidence suggesting that stable personality traits may represent proximate mechanisms through which a behavioral preference for risky outcomes manifests. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

As an example we shortened the Thought Occurrence Questionnaire Sport from 17 to three items. We argue why this short version still satisfies quality criteria and why such short(ened) questionnaires should be more appreciated (e.g., by publishing and using them in counseling settings).},

abstract = {Depression is well known to share a negative cross-sectional relationship with personality constructs defined by positive emotion (positive affect, extraversion, behavioral activation). These Positive Emotionality (PE) constructs have been proposed to represent stable temperamental risk factors for depression, not merely current mood state. These constructs have also been proposed to increase risk specifically for depression, relative to anxiety. We performed a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies to examine the relationship of PE to depression (59 effect sizes) and anxiety (26 effect sizes). In cross-sectional analyses, PE constructs were negatively associated with depression (r = −.34) and anxiety (r = −.24). PE constructs also prospectively predicted depression (r = −.26) and anxiety (r = −.19). These relationships remained statistically significant, but were markedly attenuated, when baseline levels of depression ($\beta$ = −.08) and anxiety ($\beta$ = −.06) were controlled. Moreover, depression and anxiety were equally strong predictors of subsequent changes in PE ($\beta$ = −.07 and −.09, respectively). These findings are consistent with theoretical accounts of low PE as a temperamental vulnerability for depression, but suggest that the prospective relationship of PE to depression may be weaker and less specific than previously assumed.

@article{George1998,
abstract = {Self and identity are central concepts in the social and behavioral sciences for multiple reasons. At least three major research traditions focus on the self. First, sociologists view the self as a primary bridge between social structures and individual attitudes and behaviors, as a mechanism by which social structures and individuals affect and are affected by each other. Second, self and identity are viewed as cornerstones of well-being. Thus, social and behavioral scientists have documented important links between the self and physical and mental health, role performance, the quality of interpersonal relationships, and subjective well-being. Third, the self is conceptualized as a central motivating force in human behavior. Issues as diverse as self-selection into specific environments, defense mechanisms, and the desire and ability to break addictive behaviors have been informed by attention to the motivational force of the self. This latter tradition serves as the conceptual bedrock of this paper. This paper examines three components of the self: self-efficacy, self-esteem, and a sense of authenticity. The first two have received substantial theoretical and empirical attention; the latter, much less. I argue that this unequal distribution of scientific inquiry is a result of too much emphasis on the motivation to protect the self, to the neglect of motivation to enhance the self. I make a case for the particular importance of examining self-enhancement in late life. DEFINITIONAL ISSUES At the outset, it is important to clarify several concepts related to self and identity. The ways those concepts are used here are compatible with the bulk of theory and research to date. Nonetheless, scholars sometimes put slightly differing spins on these terms; thus, brief attention to defini-tional issues is warranted. For our purposes, the terms self and identity will be used interchange-ably to refer to the individuals global view of himself or herself. Some schol-ars reserve the term identity for components of the self that are based on experience in social roles (e.g., Burke {\&} Reitzes, 1981). But most view iden-tity as encompassing more than that (Gecas, 1982; Gecas {\&} Burke, 1995; Stryker, 1987). Three specific components of the self will be the primary emphasis of this paper: self-efficacy, self-esteem, and a sense of authentic-ity. In line with previous work, self-efficacy refers to perceptions that one has basic control over one's life (Bandura, 1977; Gecas, 1989; Seligman, 1975). Of particular emphasis here is the corollary notion that self-efficacy is essentially a judgement about self-competence. That is, people who view themselves as self-efficacious believe that they are sufficiently competent to achieve the ends they want and to avoid those they do not want. Also in line with previous theory and research, self-esteem refers to the evaluative part of the self—i.e., to feelings of self-worth (George, 1995; Rosenberg, 1979). Self-esteem is probably the most studied component of the self and is viewed as especially important for mental health. In contrast to self-ef-ficacy and self-esteem, sense of authenticity has received limited attention. For our purposes, and compatible with the views of major figures in this emerging research tradition, sense of authenticity refers to the sense that one's life, both public and private, reflects one's real self (Goffman, 1959; McGuire, 1984; Swann, 1990). All three of these components of identity apply at both general and specific levels. Thus, we can assess individuals' overall or global perceptions of self-efficacy, self-esteem, and sense of authenticity; but they also can be assessed for specific domains of life ex-perience (e.g., in the economic or interpersonal realms). Some scholars view these components as processual. Most commonly, it has been posited that self-esteem is, in part, a function of self-efficacy. It also is possible, however, that the causal direction is the opposite of this: that feelings of self-worth increase perceptions of self-efficacy. To date, evi-dence about these competing hypotheses (or demonstrating that the influ-ences are reciprocal) is lacking. Regardless of the causal or temporal processes involved, these three components of self and identity are ex-pected to be interrelated. The nature of these relationships is discussed further below.},

We find that where important attitudes, behavior, or lifestyle changes are concerned, self-persuasion strategies produce more powerful and more long-lasting effects than do direct techniques of persuasion. This is primarily due to the fact that in direct persuasion, members of an audience are constantly aware of the fact that someone is trying (or has tried) to influence them. In a self-persuasion situation, people are convinced that the motivation for change comes from within.

Three primary aims were explored: 1) Examine the factor structure and fit of three versions of the CD-RISC: the original 25-item CD-RISC, both as a 25-item five factor scale and as a 25-item unidimensional scale, and the 10-item CD-RISC-10; 2) examine gender invariance of the best fitting version of the CD-RISC; and 3) examine the validity of the best fitting CD-RISC by relating it to affect and performance anxiety in a sample of competitive American distance runners (N = 409). Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Multiple self-report questionnaires were delivered through an online medium. Results: Using confirmatory factor and item level analyses, the CD-RISC-10-item scale was psychometrically superior to the unidimensional 25-item and the five factor 25-item CD-RISC versions. The CD-RISC-10-item exhibited measurement invariance for gender, with significant configural, strong, and weak analyses. Using structure equation modeling, the CD-RISC-10-item scale moderately and positively correlated with positive affect and was inversely related to negative affect and performance anxiety, establishing convergent and divergent validity. Conclusion: The findings offer some initial psychometric evidence for the use of the CD-RISC-10 in sport performers.},

abstract = {There is a substantial body of work in the scientific literature discussing the role of risk-taking behavior in the causation of injury. Despite the quantity of diverse writings on the subject most is in the form of theoretical commentaries. This review was conducted to critically assess the empirical evidence supporting the association between injury and risk-taking behavior. The review found six case-control studies and one retrospective cohort study, which met all the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the diversity of the independent and outcome variables in each of the studies reviewed. Overall the review found that risk-taking behavior, however it is measured, is associated with an increased chance of sustaining an injury except in the case of high skilled, risk-taking sports where the effect may be in the other direction. Drawing specific conclusions from the research presented in this review is difficult without an agreed conceptual framework for examining risk-taking behavior and injury. Considerable work needs to be done to provide a convincing evidence base on which to build public health interventions around risk behavior. However, sufficient evidence exists to suggest that effort in this area may be beneficial for the health of the community.},

abstract = {Introduction Many New Zealand rural workers have repeated low back pain (LBP) episodes yet continue to work. We wanted to find out why, given that other manual workers with LBP often end up on long term sick leave or permanently disabled. Methods Our primarily qualitative approach used mixed methods to investigate rural workers with non-specific LBP. Participants (n = 33) were surveyed for demographic data, the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire and the General Self Efficacy Scale followed by one-to-one semi-structured interviews. Analysis ranged from descriptive content to detailed qualitative Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results Participants had high self efficacy scores, positive perceptions about LBP but strong beliefs that LBP is life-long. Four distinct themes emerged. ''Thinking with my head before my back'' and ''Knowing the risks'' described participants' innovation regarding job modifications. ''Just carry on'' and ''Love of the land'' related to stoical resil-ience and commitment to something more than employ-ment. Conclusions This rural workforce adopts a 'can do' attitude to work, managing LBP within the context of having job control and flexible work practices. Implica-tions: Rehabilitation interventions promoting job control and targeting positive attitudes towards getting on with work, whilst accepting LBP as part of everyday life, may have merit for other workers with LBP.},

abstract = {Objectives: Fostering individuals' long-term participation in activities that promote positive development such as organised sport is an important agenda for research and practice. We integrated the theories of planned behaviour (TPB) and basic psychological needs (BPN) to identify factors associated with young adults' continuation in organised sport over a 12-month period. Design: Prospective study, including an online psycho-social assessment at Time 1 and an assessment of continuation in sport approximately 12 months later. Methods: Participants (N=. 292) aged between 17 and 21 years (M=. 18.03; SD. =. 1.29) completed an online survey assessing the theories of planned behaviour and basic psychological needs constructs. Bayesian structural equation modelling (BSEM) was employed to test the hypothesised theoretical sequence, using informative priors for structural relations based on empirical and theoretical expectations. Results: The analyses revealed support for the robustness of the hypothesised theoretical model in terms of the pattern of relations as well as the direction and strength of associations among the constructs derived from quantitative summaries of existing research and theoretical expectations. The satisfaction of basic psychological needs was associated with more positive attitudes, higher levels of perceived behavioural control, and more favourable subjective norms; positive attitudes and perceived behavioural control were associated with higher behavioural intentions; and both intentions and perceived behavioural control predicted sport continuation. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the utility of Bayesian structural equation modelling for testing the robustness of an integrated theoretical model, which is informed by empirical evidence from meta-analyses and theoretical expectations, for understanding sport continuation.},

With random predictors, this method also fails to account for the sampling variability of the predictor standard deviations. Nevertheless, under some conditions the standard method will produce CIs with accurate coverage rates. To delineate these conditions, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to compute empirical CI coverage rates in samples drawn from 36 populations with a wide range of data characteristics. We also computed the empirical CI coverage rates for 4 alternative methods that have been discussed in the literature: noncentrality interval estimation, the delta method, the percentile bootstrap, and the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap. Our results showed that for many data-parameter configurations--for example, sample size, predictor correlations, coefficient of determination (R²), orientation of $\beta$ with respect to the eigenvectors of the predictor correlation matrix, RX--the standard method produced coverage rates that were close to their expected values. However, when population R² was large and when $\beta$ approached the last eigenvector of RX, then the standard method coverage rates were frequently below the nominal rate (sometimes by a considerable amount). In these conditions, the delta method and the 2 bootstrap procedures were consistently accurate. Results using noncentrality interval estimation were inconsistent. In light of these findings, we recommend that researchers use the delta method to evaluate the sampling variability of standardized regression coefficients.},

This study explores how the three main amateur user groups of avalanche terrain in western Canada (backcountry skiers, out-of-bound skiers, and snow- mobile riders) balance recreational goals with safety concerns when choosing backcountry destinations under varying avalanche conditions. Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), a stated preference technique, the study first examines the strengths and weak- nesses in the decision process of the three amateur groups by comparing their responses with the choice patterns of professional mountain guides. The results show that the decision-making strategies employed by the respective amateur groups vary considerably in their level of complexity and the degree to which avalanche safety considerations are incorporated. Second, we examine the effects of a decision aid that preprocesses the most crucial pieces of avalanche hazard information on the decision preferences of the amateur groups in the DCE. The results show that a relatively simple decision aid can influence the decision-making process considerably and steer users towards more avalanche hazard sensitive behaviour.},

abstract = {In alpine skiing, a controversial discussion has been taking place regarding the potential influence of wearing a ski helmet on the individual level of risk taking behaviour. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether self reported risk taking behaviour and self reported risk compensation are associated with the personality trait sensation seeking (SS) in alpine skiing and snowboarding. In total, 683 persons (36{\%} males and 64{\%} females) completed an online-survey about attitudes and use of protective gear in winter sports including the German version of the sensation seeking scale form V. A logistic regression analysis including gender, age, nationality, preferred winter sport, self reported skiing ability, mean skiing time per season, use of ski helmets, and SS total score was used to estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95{\%} confidence intervals (95 CI) for self reported risk taking behaviour. Regression analysis revealed that a more risky behaviour increased with male gender (OR: 2.7), with an age {\textless} 25 years (OR: 1.6), with skiing (OR: 1.3), higher skill level (OR: 5.7), and a mean skiing time {\textgreater} 28 days per season (OR: 2.2). In addition, SS total score was significantly higher in more risky compared to more cautious people (23.8 vs. 20.3, p {\textless}.001). Ski helmet use was not found to be predictive for a more risky behaviour (p {\textgreater}.05). Also, skiers and snowboarders with self reported risk compensation while wearing a ski helmet had higher SS total scores compared to those who did not report risk compensation (23.8 vs. 20.9, p =.001). In addition, self reported risk compensation in helmet wearers increased with an age {\textless} 25 years (OR: 2.2), a higher skill level (OR: 2.5) and a mean skiing time {\textgreater} 28 days per season (OR: 2.1). In conclusion, self reported risk taking and self reported risk compensation are associated with higher sensation seeking total scores. The personality trait sensation seeking, not wearing of a ski helmet, appears to be associated with riskier behaviour on the ski slopes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Context. The benefits of continuity of pediatric care remain controversial. Objective. To determine whether there is an association between having a continuous relationship with a primary care pediatric provider and decreased risk of emergency department (ED) visitation and hospitalization. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Population. We used claims data from 46 097 pediatric patients enrolled at Group Health Cooperative, a large staff-model health maintenance organization, between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 1998, for our analysis. To be eligible, patients had to have been continuously enrolled for at least a 2-year period or since birth and to have made at least 4 visits to one of the Group Health Cooperative clinics. Main Exposure Variable. A continuity of care (COC) index that quantifies the degree to which a patient has experienced continuous care with a provider. Main Outcome Measures. ED utilization and hospitalization. Results. Compared with children with the highest COC, children with medium continuity were more likely to have visited the ED (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.28 [1.20-1.36]) and more likely to be hospitalized (HR: 1.22 [1.09-1.38]). Children with the lowest COC were even more likely to have visited the ED (HR: 1.58 [1.49-1.66]) and to be hospitalized (HR: 1.54 [1.33-1.75]). These risks were even greater for children on Medicaid and those with asthma. Conclusions. Lower continuity of primary care is associated with higher risk of ED utilization and hospitalization. Efforts to improve and maintain continuity may be warranted.},

abstract = {Paul Barrett offers a challenging and timely call for a re-examination of fit assessment strategies in structural equation modelling (SEM). He points out that widely accepted cutoff values for approximate fit indices have come to be treated as if they were test statistics. Paul cites four recent studies of the behaviour of fit indices under varying data conditions which demonstrate that universal indicative cutoff values cannot be trusted. Based upon these studies, Paul advocates the abandonment of approximate fit indices and greater reliance on the chi square test and a broader assessment strategy that includes predictive accuracy. I share Paul's concerns about the lax standards often adopted in model testing and I agree with most of his arguments. However, the authors he cites in support of his recommendation to abandon approximate fit indices do not reach the same conclusion as Paul. In my response to Paul's article, I discuss some conditions under which it could be legitimate to accept a model which has failed the chi square test and I contend that approximate fit indices can play a useful part in a multi-faceted strategy for determining model adequacy, provided they are not elevated to the status of golden rules. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The sporting arena is replete with examples and anecdotes of great inspirational coaches that have led teams to success, often in the face of adversity and against seemingly better opponents. The role of the coach in developing and motivating athletes has also been the focus of much research in sport psychology (e.g., Challaduria 1990; Smith {\&} Smoll, 2007). Despite the ease with which one readily accepts that coaches can be inspirational, the sport coaching literature is somewhat devoid of research on inspirational coaches and the effects of such coaches on athletic success. The purpose of the current paper is to theoretically delineate the inspirational effects of coaches in sport. Given the relative paucity of inspiration-related research in sport we draw upon contemporary theories of leadership from organisational and military psychology (e.g., transformational and charismatic leadership theories). We propose a sport-specific model of leadership that centres around the vision, support, and challenge meta-cognitive model developed by Arthur and Hardy in military contexts. The model posits that ‘great' coaches inspire their athletes by: (a) creating an inspirational vision of the future; (b) providing the necessary support to achieve the vision; and (c) providing the challenge to achieve the vision. The underlying proposition is that the vision provides meaning and direction for followers' effort. That is, the vision serves as the beacon around which all the sweat, pain and sacrifice involved in achieving success at the highest level in sport is directed. At the heart of this model is the notion that athletes can achieve their dreams provided they are inspired to do so; this is because all other things being equal the person who is motivated to practice longer and train harder will ultimately be the best. The current paper will delineate the coach's role in inspiring the athlete to train harder and longer. Keywords:},

The meta-analysis was based on 1,728 effect sizes drawn from 151 unique samples from 96 studies, and the average effect size at the end of the programs was .34. In a remarkable contrast to most educational research, these short-term or immediate gains were followed by substantial additional gains between the end of the program and follow-up assessments ( ES = .17). The effect sizes varied substantially according the particular program and outcome and improved as the length of the program and the ages of participants increased.

abstract = {Endurance athletes draw on several sources of self-efficacy, but there is a limited understanding of what information within these sources specifically contributes towards self-efficacy. An increased understanding and awareness of the sources of self-efficacy for endurance performance would allow the design and delivery of more effective self-efficacy interventions. The aim of the current study was to identify sources of self-efficacy specific to the endurance sport domain. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve experienced competitive endurance athletes who had been competing in their endurance sport for an average of 12.2 ± 6.25 years. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using deductive thematic analysis. Past performance experiences, physiological states, social/verbal persuasions and emotional states were generated as initial themes. Within these themes, six sub-themes were identified: cumulative experiences, challenge and adversity, physical familiarity, social support, self-talk, and doubt and worry. Our results indicate that endurance athletes make use of several sources of self-efficacy in the formation and maintenance of their self-efficacy beliefs. Specifically, the culmination of experiences, experiences of overcoming challenge and adversity, and a sense of physical familiarity appeared to key sources in the endurance sport domain.},

@article{Higgins1987,
abstract = {This article presents a theory of how different types of discrepancies between self-state representations are related to different kinds of emotional vulnerabilities. One domain of the self (actual; ideal; ought) and one standpoint on the self (own; significant other) constitute each type of self-state representation. It is proposed that different types of self-discrepancies represent different types of negative psychological situations that are associated with different kinds of discomfort. Discrepancies between the actual/own self-state (i.e., the self-concept) and ideal self-stales (i.e., representations of an individual's beliefs about his or her own or a significant other's hopes, wishes, or aspirations for the individual) signify the absence of positive outcomes, which is associated with dejection-related emotions (e.g., disappointment, dissatisfaction, sadness). In contrast, discrepancies between the ac-tual/own self-state and ought self-states (i.e., representations of an individual's beliefs about his or her own or a significant other's beliefs about the individual's duties, responsibilities, or obligations) signify the presence of negative outcomes, which is associated with agitation-related emotions (e.g., fear, threat, restlessness). Differences in both the relative magnitude and the accessibility of individu-als' available types of self-discrepancies are predicted to be related to differences in the kinds of discomfort people are likely to experience. Correlational and experimental evidence supports the predictions of the model. Differences between serf-discrepancy theory and (a) other theories of incompatible self-beliefs and (b) actual self negativity (e.g., low self-esteem) are discussed. The notion that people who hold conflicting or incompatible beliefs are likely to experience discomfort has had a long history in psychology. In social psychology, for example, various early theories proposed a relation between discomfort and specific kinds of "inconsistency" among a person's beliefs (e.g., Abelson {\&} Rosenberg, 1958; Festinger, 1957; Heider, 1958; McGuire, 1968; Newcomb, 1968; Osgood {\&} Tannenbaum, 1955). And various classic theories relating self and affect proposed that self-conflicts or self-inconsistencies produce emotional problems (e.g., Adler},

abstract = {Data collected through smart travel cards in public transport networks have become a valuable source of information for transport geography studies. During the last two decades, a growing body of literature has used this sort of data source to study the behaviour of public transport users in cities and regions around the world. However, its use has been scarce in contexts where public transport demand is highly influenced by the activities of the tourist sector. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether these data can be leveraged to optimize the supply of public transport. In this article, data drawn from the Camp de Tarragona automated fare collection system extracted during 2018 are used to study tourists' use of public transport in Costa Daurada (Catalonia, Spain). This is a popular coastal destination with a high concentration of visitors during the summer period. The analysis focuses on the use of the T-10, a multipersonal transport fare with no time limitations on its use which makes it appealing for tourists. Model-based clustering has been applied to identify different clusters of passengers according to their activity and spatial profiles. Differences between profiles are significant and, as a result, this study allowed the validation of a method that could be replicated in other contexts, as it provides highly useful information for public transport policy and mobility management.},

This is especially true for those researchers without a formal background in information theory. Here, we highlight a number of practical obstacles to model averaging complex models. Although not meant to be an exhaustive review, we identify several important issues with tentative solutions where they exist (e.g. dealing with collinearity amongst predictors; how to compute model-averaged parameters) and highlight areas for future research where solutions are not clear (e.g. when to use random intercepts or slopes; which information criteria to use when random factors are involved). We also provide a worked example of a mixed model analysis of inbreeding depression in a wild population. By providing an overview of these issues, we hope that this approach will become more accessible to those investigating any process where multiple variables impact an evolutionary or ecological response.},

PAMS extends the use of simple multidimensional scaling methods to identify latent profiles in a multi-test battery. Application of PAMS to profile analysis is described. The PAMS model is then used to identify latent profiles from a subgroup (N = 357) within the sample of the Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery—Revised (WJ-R; McGrew, Werder, {\&} Woodcock, 1991; Woodcock {\&} Johnson, 1989), followed by a discussion of procedures for interpreting participants' observed score profiles from the latent PAMS profiles.

To date, the contribution of qualitative literature in this area has largely been ignored, despite the value this research brings to the understanding of complex social constructs such as stigma. The aim of the current systematic review of qualitative studies was to identify appropriate literature, assess the quality and synthesize findings across studies regarding evidence of stigma-related barriers and facilitators to help seeking for mental health issues within the armed forces. A multi-database text word search incorporating searches of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Social Policy and Practice, Social Work Abstracts, EMBASE, ERIC and EBM Review databases between 1980 and April 2015 was conducted. Literature was quality assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. Thematic synthesis was conducted across the literature. The review identified eight studies with 1012 participants meeting the inclusion criteria. Five overarching themes were identified across the literature: (1) non-disclosure; (2) individual beliefs about mental health; (3) anticipated and personal experience of stigma; (4) career concerns; and (5) factors influencing stigma. The findings from the current systematic review found that unlike inconsistent findings in the quantitative literature, there was substantial evidence of a negative relationship between stigma and help seeking for mental health difficulties within the armed forces. The study advocates for refinement of measures to accurately capture the complexity of stigma and help seeking in future quantitative studies.},

abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) are the two most common approaches to missing data analysis. In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on gamma, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.},

abstract = {Theory indicates that resilient individuals " bounce back " from stressful experiences quickly and effectively. Few studies, however, have provided empirical evidence for this theory. The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions (B. L. Fredrickson, 1998, 2001) is used as a framework for understanding psychological resilience. The authors used a multimethod approach in 3 studies to predict that resilient people use positive emotions to rebound from, and find positive meaning in, stressful encounters. Mediational analyses revealed that the experience of positive emotions contributed, in part, to participants' abilities to achieve efficient emotion regulation, demonstrated by accelerated cardiovascular recovery from negative emotional arousal (Studies 1 and 2) and by finding positive meaning in negative circumstances (Study 3). Implications for research on resilience and positive emotions are discussed. There are individuals who seem to " bounce back " from negative events quite effectively, whereas others are caught in a rut, seemingly unable to get out of their negative streaks. Being able to move on despite negative stressors does not demonstrate luck on the part of those successful individuals but demonstrates a concept known as resilience. Psychological resilience refers to effective coping and adaptation although faced with loss, hardship, or ad-versity. Resilience to certain events has been likened to elasticity in metals (Lazarus, 1993). For example, cast iron is hard, brittle, and breaks easily (not resilient), whereas wrought iron is soft, malleable, and bends without breaking (resilient). This metaphor can be carried over to psychological resilience, which entails a similar resistance to the psychological strain associated with negative experiences. This investigation examines psychological resilience, focusing on its subjective, cognitive, and physiological qualities.},

abstract = {In this study, we wished to determine whether the perceived support available from team-mates predicts levels of self-confidence. Four dimensions of support were examined: emotional, esteem, informational, and tangible. The sample consisted of 152 university athletes (74 females, 78 males) with a mean age of 20.1 years (s=1.4). Participants completed measures of perceived support, stressors, and self-confidence at the training session before an important match. Moderated hierarchical regression analyses revealed that all four dimensions of support had direct effects on self-confidence (R2=0.13-0.17, all P0.01), with support positively predicting self-confidence. Perceived emotional (R2=0.05, P0.05), esteem (R2=0.02, P0.05), and informational (R2=0.03, P 0.05) support also had stress-buffering effects on self-confidence. The findings suggest that although university athletes perceived different levels of emotional, esteem, informational, and tangible support to be available from their team-mates, all four dimensions of support positively predicted self-confidence.},

@article{Ajzen1986,
abstract = {A proposed theory of planned behavior, an extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's (1980, Understanding attitudes and predicting social behavior. Englewood-Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall) theory of reasoned action, was tested in two experiments. The extended theory incorporates perceived control over behavioral achievement as a determinant of intention (Version 1) as well as behavior (Version 2). In Experiment 1, college students' attendance of class lectures was recorded over a 6-week period; in Experiment 2, the behavioral goal was getting an "A" in a course. Attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions were assessed halfway through the period of observation in the first experiment, and at two points in time in the second experiment. The results were evaluated by means of hierarchical regression analyses. As expected, the theory of planned behavior permitted more accurate prediction of intentions and goal attainment than did the theory of reasoned action. In both experiments, perceived behavioral control added significantly to the prediction of intentions. Its contribution to the prediction of behavior was significant in the second wave of Experiment 2, at which time the students' perceptions of behavioral control had become quite accurate. Contrary to expectations, there was little evidence for interactions between perceived behavioral control and the theory's other independent variables. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

A sample of 163 undergraduate students at a large midwestern university completed a test packet containing the Attributional Style Questionnaire, the Self-Efficacy Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and the Bern Sex Role Inventory. Multiple correlation and regression analyses were used to analyze their responses. Results indicated that masculinity and self-esteem were important in the prediction of the adaptive success attributions of women and masculinity was important in the prediction of the adaptive success attributions of men, however, sex and femininity had little relationship with success and failure attributions. Masculinity was the best unique predictor of attributional styles for success and failure. In addition, better prediction occurred for attributional styles for success than attributional styles for failure. The implications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for future research are made. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Measurement invariance (MI) is a pre-requisite for comparing latent variable scores across groups. The current paper introduces the concept of approximate MI building on the work of Muth{\'{e}}n and Asparouhov and their application of Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (BSEM) in the software Mplus. They showed that with BSEM exact zeros constraints can be replaced with approximate zeros to allow for minimal steps away from strict MI, still yielding a well-fitting model. This new opportunity enables researchers to make explicit trade-offs between the degree of MI on the one hand, and the degree of model fit on the other. Throughout the paper we discuss the topic of approximate MI, followed by an empirical illustration where the test for MI fails, but where allowing for approximate MI results in a well-fitting model. Using simulated data, we investigate in which situations approximate MI can be applied and when it leads to unbiased results. Both our empirical illustration and the simulation study show approximate MI outperforms full or partial MI In detecting/recovering the true latent mean difference when there are (many) small differences in the intercepts and factor loadings across groups. In the discussion we provide a step-by-step guide in which situation what type of MI is preferred. Our paper provides a first step in the new research area of (partial) approximate MI and shows that it can be a good alternative when strict MI leads to a badly fitting model and when partial MI cannot be applied.},

Fit for purpose means that the helmet is functional for the activities in which it is worn and protects the head within a sport's injury risk management objectives. For example, if the objective is to prevent severe skull and brain injury in a high velocity impact, a helmet without any impact energy attenuating liner will not satisfy that objective. If, on the other hand, the objective is to provide protection against minor impacts that might disturb the wearer or cause superfcial injury, a helmet comprising of a shell and comfort liner may suffce. Setting the risk management objectives is a critical step to ensure that the helmet matches the expectations of the athlete.

We describe a new rating scale to assess resilience. The Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) comprises of 25 items, each rated on a 5-point scale (0-4), with higher scores reflecting greater resilience. The scale was administered to subjects in the following groups: community sample, primary care outpatients, general psychiatric outpatients, clinical trial of generalized anxiety disorder, and two clinical trials of PTSD. The reliability, validity, and factor analytic structure of the scale were evaluated, and reference scores for study samples were calculated. Sensitivity to treatment effects was examined in subjects from the PTSD clinical trials. The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties and factor analysis yielded five factors. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that an increase in CD-RISC score was associated with greater improvement during treatment. Improvement in CD-RISC score was noted in proportion to overall clinical global improvement, with greatest increase noted in subjects with the highest global improvement and deterioration in CD-RISC score in those with minimal or no global improvement. The CD-RISC has sound psychometric properties and distinguishes between those with greater and lesser resilience. The scale demonstrates that resilience is modifiable and can improve with treatment, with greater improvement corresponding to higher levels of global improvement.},

Personality traits and attitudes toward risk were correlated with both problem gambling and general gambling involvement. Behavioral measures were positively correlated with general gambling involvement. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that both problem gambling and general gambling involvement loaded on single factors with other measures of risk, suggesting that gambling represents one expression of a general propensity for risk-taking. Future study of the causes of gambling behavior may benefit from integration within a more general framework of risk-taking. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Data sources were located by combining conscientiousness-related terms and relevant health-related behavior terms in database searches as well as by retrieving dissertations and requesting unpublished data from electronic mailing lists. The resulting database contained 194 studies that were quantitatively synthesized. Results showed that conscientiousness-related traits were negatively related to all risky health-related behaviors and positively related to all beneficial health-related behaviors.

abstract = {ISSN: 0027-3171 (Print) 1532-7906 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/hmbr20 ABSTRACT There is a recent increase in interest of Bayesian analysis. However, little effort has been made thus far to directly incorporate background knowledge via the prior distribution into the analyses. This process might be especially useful in the context of latent growth mixture modeling when one or more of the latent groups are expected to be relatively small due to what we refer to as limited data. We argue that the use of Bayesian statistics has great advantages in limited data situations, but only if background knowledge can be incorporated into the analysis via prior distributions. We highlight these advantages through a data set including patients with burn injuries and analyze trajectories of posttraumatic stress symptoms using the Bayesian framework following the steps of the WAMBS-checklist. In the included example, we illustrate how to obtain background information using previous literature based on a systematic literature search and by using expert knowledge. Finally, we show how to translate this knowledge into prior distributions and we illustrate the importance of conducting a prior sensitivity analysis. Although our example is from the trauma field, the techniques we illustrate can be applied to any field.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental questions addressed by risk-benefit analysis is "How safe is safe enough?" Chauncey Starr has proposed that economic data be used to reveal patterns of acceptable risk-benefit tradeoffs. The present study investigates an alternative technique, in which psychometric procedures were used to elicit quantitative judgments of perceived risk, acceptable risk, and perceived benefit for each of 30 activities and technologies. The participants were seventy-six members of the League of Women Voters. The results indicated little systematic relationship between perceived existing risks and benefits of the 30 risk items. Current risk levels were generally viewed as unacceptably high. When current risk levels were adjusted to what would be considered acceptable risk levels, however, risk was found to correlate with benefit. Nine descriptive attributes of risk were also studied. These nine attributes seemed to tap two basic dimensions of risk. These dimensions proved to be effective predictors of the tradeoff between acceptable risk and perceived benefit. The limitations of the present study and the relationship between this technique and Starr's technique are discussed, along with the implications of the findings for policy decisions.},

Implicit social attentional biases can also influence psychological and physiological stress responses. The purpose of this study was to explore whether a coping style characterized by greater use of social support predicts indices of cortisol activity in laboratory and daily life contexts among female university students. We hypothesized that the relation of this coping style to cortisol activity would be moderated by women's attentional biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Seventy-four women (Mage = 19.44, range: 17.8-27.8, 64{\%} White) completed an interpersonal stress task and an attentional bias task in the lab, along with a self-report coping inventory. Participants provided five saliva samples during the lab protocol, followed by three saliva samples per day for three consecutive weekdays.

To date, most studies of the human dimensions of decision making in avalanche terrain has fo- cused on two areas - post-accident analysis using accident reports/interviews and, the development of tools as decision forcing aids. We present an alternate method for understanding decision-making in ava- lanche terrain. Our project combines real-time GPS tracking via a smartphone application, with internet based surveys of backcountry skiers as a method to describe and quantify travel practices in concert with group decision-making dynamics, and demographic data of participants during daily excursions into win- ter backcountry. Preliminary data analysis shows that individual experience levels and regional avalanche danger ratings all influence the ways in which people travel in avalanche terrain. Our results will provide the first analysis of coupled real-time GPS tracking of people moving in avalanche terrain combined with psychographic and demographic correlates. This research will lead to an improved understanding of real- time decision making in avalanche terrain},

abstract = {Background: The relationship of health risk behavior and disease in adulthood to the breadth of exposure to childhood emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, and household dysfunction during childhood has not previously been described. Methods: A questionnaire about adverse childhood experiences was mailed to 13,494 adults who had completed a standardized medical evaluation at a large HMO; 9,508 (70.5{\%}) responded. Seven categories of adverse childhood experiences were studied: psychological, physical, or sexual abuse; violence against mother; or living with household members who were substance abusers, mentally ill or suicidal, or ever imprisoned. The number of categories of these adverse childhood experiences was then compared to measures of adult risk behavior, health status, and disease. Logistic regression was used to adjust for effects of demographic factors on the association between the cumulative number of categories of childhood exposures (range: 0-7) and risk factors for the leading causes of death in adult life. Results: More than half of respondents reported at least one, and one-fourth reported ≤2 categories of childhood exposures. We found a graded relationship between the number of categories of childhood exposure and each of the adult health risk behaviors and diseases that were studied (P {\textless} .001). Persons who had experienced four or more categories of childhood exposure, compared to those who had experienced none, had 4- to 12-fold increased health risks for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and suicide attempt; a 2- to 4-fold increase in smoking, poor self-rated health, ≤50 sexual intercourse partners, and sexually transmitted disease; and a 1.4- to 1.6- fold increase in physical inactivity and severe obesity. The number of categories of adverse childhood exposures showed a graded relationship to the presence of adult diseases including ischemic heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, skeletal fractures, and liver disease. The seven categories of adverse childhood experiences were strongly interrelated and persons with multiple categories of childhood exposure were likely to have multiple health risk factors later in life. Conclusions: We found a strong graded relationship between the breadth of exposure to abuse or household dysfunction during childhood and multiple risk factors for several of the leading causes of death in adults.},

DesignCross-sectional field study, with the multistage 20 m shuttle run test (MST) employed as a proxy for behavioural perseverance. Methods: 330 male Australian footballers aged between 15 and 18 years (M=16.86; SD=.71) with between 2 and 14 years playing experience (M=9.32; SD=2.51) participated. Initially, footballers completed a mental toughness questionnaire, before having their height and body mass measurements taken. Subsequently, a performance testing session was completed, which included the 20 m sprint, Australian football-specific agility run, vertical jump, and the MST. Bayesian estimation was employed to allow for the simultaneous examination of existing findings with our new data in a way that provides an automatic meta-analysis of evidence in this area. Results: The analysis indicated a 95{\%} probability that the association between mental toughness and behavioural perseverance lies between .14 and .34, even when controlling for other factors known to influence MST performance, including age, height, body mass, and years playing experience. Conclusions: Taken together with previous research, these findings support the theoretical proposition that persistence, effort or perseverance represents a behavioural signature of mental toughness.},

Routinely collected UK primary care data have previously been used for national pandemic surveillance, quantifying associations between exposures and outcomes, identifying highrisk populations and examining the effects of interventions at scale. However, there is no consensus on how to effectively conduct or report these data for COVID-19 research. A COVID-19 primary care database consortium was established in April 2020. Collectively, its researchers have ongoing COVID19 projects in overlapping datasets with millions of primary care records representing 30{\%} of the UK population, that are variously linked to public health, secondary care and vital status records. This consensus agreement is aimed at facilitating transparency and rigour in methodological approaches, as well as consistency in defining and reporting cases, exposures, confounders, stratification variables and outcomes in relation to the pharmacoepidemiology of COVID-19. This will facilitate comparison, validation and pooling of research during and after the pandemic.},

abstract = {Stable personality traits have long been presumed to have biological substrates, although the evidence relat-ing personality to biological stress reactivity is inconclusive. The present study examined, in a large middle aged cohort (N = 352), the relationship between key personality traits and both cortisol and cardiovascular reactions to acute psychological stress. Salivary cortisol and cardiovascular activity were measured at rest and in response to a psychological stress protocol comprising 5 min each of a Stroop task, mirror tracing, and a speech task. Participants subsequently completed the Big Five Inventory to assess neuroticism, agreeableness, openness to experience, extraversion, and conscientiousness. Those with higher neuroticism scores exhibited smaller cortisol and cardiovascular stress reactions, whereas participants who were less agreeable and less open had smaller cortisol and cardiac reactions to stress. These associations remained statistically significant following adjustment for a range of potential confounding variables. Thus, a negative personality disposition would appear to be linked to diminished stress reactivity. These findings further support a growing body of evidence which suggests that blunted stress reactivity may be maladaptive.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Objectives: The present study is a longitudinal research which uses baseline individual attributes for predicting three measures of individual resilience in two consecutive periods of terror attacks. Design and setting: Regressions determined the impact of personality attributes at time 1 on measures of resil-ience at times 2 and 3, beyond the effects of each measure of resilience at time 1. Three path analyses examined the impact of baseline attributes on resilience of civilians throughout a wave of terror. Participants: The 561 participating civilian adults constituted 55{\%} of a representative internet sample of the Israeli Jewish population, who responded to the research questionnaire three times: before and throughout this wave of terror. Participants were lower middle-class males and females, with some academic education, representing the Israeli political range. Measurements: Resilience supporting personality attributes (sense of coherence, social support, and perceived community resilience), and resilience suppressing factors (exposure to terror, and sense of danger) predicted re-silience which was measured by strength to vulnerability ratio (IND-SVR). Results: The investigated attributes predicted protective and risk factors of post-terror resilience. Conclusion: This longitudinal study corroborates the theoretical position that resilience constitutes an integration of individual protective processes and risk elements, both of which are required for understanding adaptation fol-lowing adversities. Furthermore, it supports the contention that individual resilience is contingent upon, and pre-dicted by personality attributes and attitudes.},

To explore the trends in this new body of literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of 116 empirical studies of intragroup conflict (n = 8,880 groups) and its relationship with group outcomes. To address the heterogeneity across the studies included in the meta-analysis, we also investigated a number of moderating variables. Stable negative relationships were found between relationship and process conflict and group outcomes. In contrast to the results of De Dreu and Weingart, we did not find a strong and negative association between task conflict and group performance. Analyses of main effects as well as moderator analyses revealed a more complex picture. Task conflict and group performance were more positively related among studies where the association between task and relationship conflict was relatively weak, in studies conducted among top management teams rather than non-top management teams, and in studies where performance was measured in terms of financial performance or decision quality rather than overall performance.},

abstract = {Research exploring the development of expertise has mostly adopted linear methods to identify precursors of expertise, assessing statistical differences between groups of isolated features (variables) by way of attaching importance; e.g., deliberate practice hours (Ericsson et al., 1993). However, confining the complex nature of expertise development to linear investigations alone may be overly simplistic. Consequently, to better understand the multidimensional and complex nature of expertise development, we applied (non-linear) pattern recognition analyses to a set of 93 features obtained from a sample of 15 elite (International) and 13 sub-elite (First Class County) cricket spin bowlers. Our study revealed that a subset of 12 developmental features, from a possible 93, discriminated between the elite and sub-elite groups with very good accuracy. The 12-feature subset forms a holistic development profile, reflecting the elite's earlier engagement in cricket, greater quantity of domain-specific practice and competition, and superior adaptability to new levels of competition. Evidence for the external validity of this new model is offered by its ability to correctly classify data obtained from 5 unseen spin bowlers with 100{\%} accuracy. After consideration of these quantitative findings, the content of qualitative data provided by the cricketers was subsequently analyzed to obtain a deeper understanding of the features that discriminate between the elite and sub-elite groups.

abstract = {$\backslash$nMissing data methods, within the data mining context, are limited in computational complexity due to large data amounts. Amongst the computationally simple yet effective imputation methods are the hot deck procedures. Hot deck methods impute missing values within a data matrix by using available values from the same matrix. The object, from which these available values are taken for imputation within another, is called the donor. The replication of values leads to the problem, that a single donor might be selected to accommodate multiple recipients. The inherent risk posed by this is that too many, or even all, missing values may be imputed with the values from a single donor. To mitigate this risk, some hot deck variants limit the amount of times any one donor may be selected for donating its values. This inevitably leads to the question under which conditions such a limitation is sensible. This study aims to answer this question though an extensive simulation. The results show rather clear differences between imputations by hot deck methods in which the donor limit was varied. In addition to these differences, influencing factors are identified that determine whether or not a donor limit is sensible.$\backslash$n},

There is no all-purpose measure of perceived self-efficacy. The “one measure fits all” approach usually has limited explanatory and predictive value because most of the items in an all-purpose test may have little or no relevance to the domain of functioning. Moreover, in an effort to serve all purposes, items in such a measure are usually cast in general terms divorced from the situational dema nds and circumstances. This leaves much ambiguity about exactly what is being measured or the level of task and situational demands that must be managed.

Therefore, we analyzed data from 663 18-year-old high-school graduates, trainees, and their parents participating in the BiKS German longitudinal school study. We specified three latent classes of life-goal regulation (by using four regulation categories: extrinsic, introjected, identified, and intrinsic regulation) with a latent class analysis and examined their correlations with types of goal orientation. Especially for the latent classes with high extrinsic or high introjected regulation, we found relations with more extrinsic types of goal orientation (performance-approach goal orientation). In addition, education-related parenting behavior during secondary school predicted the different latent classes of life-goal regulation. The results are discussed in the context of self-determination theory.},

abstract = {Bayesian structural equation modeling (BSEM) has recently gained popularity because it enables researchers to fit complex models while solving some of the issues often encountered in classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, such as nonconvergence and inadmissible solutions. An important component of any Bayesian analysis is the prior distribution of the unknown model parameters. Often, researchers rely on default priors, which are constructed in an automatic fashion without requiring substantive prior information. However, the prior can have a serious influence on the estimation of the model parameters, which affects the mean squared error (MSE), bias, coverage rates, and quantiles of the estimates.In this paper, we investigate the performance of three different default priors: noninformative improper priors, vague proper priors, and empirical Bayes priors, with the latter being novel in the BSEM literature. Based on a simulation study, we find that these three default BSEM methods may perform very differently, especially with small samples. A careful prior sensitivity analysis is therefore needed when performing a default BSEM analysis. For this purpose, we provide a practical step-by-step guide for practitioners to conducting a prior sensitivity analysis in default BSEM. Our recommendations are illustrated using a well-known case study from the structural equation modeling literature and all code for conducting the prior sensitivity analysis is made available in the online supplemental material.},

abstract = {Two studies examined the reliability and validity of the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES). In Study 1, each of 37 undergraduates rode an exercise bicycle under control and external focus conditions. As predicted, Ss reported enjoying the exercise more, as measured by the PACES, in the external focus condition. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation in the control condition between Ss PACES scores and their scores on a measure of boredom proneness. In Study 2, each of 37 undergraduates rode an exercise bicycle and jogged on a minitrampoline in separate sessions; each then chose one of these activities for their 3rd session. As predicted, there was a significant relationship between Ss PACES ratings (completed after each activity) and their choices of activity. Test–retest reliability was high for jogging and moderate for bicycling. The PACES had high internal consistency in both studies.},

abstract = {The dominance of the "psychometric" paradigm and the consequent emphasis on personality profiles of hazards has resulted in little attention being given to individual variability in risk judgments. This study examines how far differences in experience of risk activities can explain individual variability in risk assessments. A questionnaire study (n = 172) was used to explore the relationships between experience and risk perceptions in relation to 16 risk activities. It was expected that these relationships would differ for voluntary and involuntary activities. Measures of experience included assessments of "impact" and "outcome" valence as well as "frequency." These three aspects of experience each related to risk assessment but their relationship depended on whether the risk experiences were voluntary or not. The results indicate the importance of developing more fine-grained ways of indexing risk experience.},

The first data set (calibration sample) consisted of 503 college-age intramural athletes, and the second (validation sample) consisted of 331 intercollegiate (Division I) and interscholastic athletes. The results of the initial CFA on the calibration sample resulted in a poor fit to the data. Using the Lagrange Multiplier Test (Gamma) as a guide, CSAI-2 items that loaded on more than one factor were sequentially deleted. The resulting 17-item revised CSAI-2 was then subjected to a CFA using the validation data sample. The results of this CFA revealed a good fit of the data to the model (CFI = .95, NNFI = .94, RMSEA = .054). It is suggested that the CSAI-2R instead of the CSAI-2 be used by researchers and practitioners for measuring competitive state anxiety in athletes.},

In this review we revisit the classic definitions of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in light of contemporary research and theory. Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {This meta-analysis explored the efficacy of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) dependent on behaviour and methodological moderators. A lack of hierarchical analysis in previous reviews risks confounding these moderators. Here moderating roles of behaviour type, length of follow-up, sample age and behavioural measure are explored hierarchically amongst prospective tests of the TPB, controlling for past behaviour where possible. Searching identified 237 prospective tests from 206 articles. Random-effects meta-analytic procedures were used to correcting correlations for sampling and measurement error. Behaviour type moderated the model; physical activity and diet behaviours were better predicted (23.9{\%} and 21.2{\%} variance explained, respectively) whilst risk, detection, safer sex and abstinence from drugs were poorly predicted (between 13.8 and 15.3{\%} variance explained). Methodological moderators were also apparent: age of sample moderated relations with student samples better predicted for physical activity, and adolescent samples better predicted for abstinence behaviours. Behaviours assessed in the shorter term, and those assessed with self-reports (compared with objective measures) were also better predicted. Both behavioural and methodological characteristics moderated relations amongst model components. The results can aid selection ofappropriate targets upon which to base interventions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Objectives: To test Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT; Deci {\&} Ryan, 2002) to determine if psychological need thwarting experienced when physically active contributes to the understanding of well-being and ill-being. Design/method: Participants (N=155, 67.70{\%} female, Mage=37.46 years; SDage=19.89 years) completed assessments of psychological need satisfaction and thwarting, subjective vitality and positive/negative affect during separate testing sessions separated by 6 months. Results: Scores from the modified version of the Psychological Need Thwarting Scale (PNTS-PA; Bartholomew, Ntoumanis, Ryan, {\&} Th{\o}gersen-Ntoumani, 2011) demonstrated discriminant evidence of validity, evidence of internal structure and minimal error variance. Changes in psychological need satisfaction positively predicted positive affect (R2=.16, p{\textless}.05), subjective vitality (R2=.13, p{\textless}.05) and negatively predicted negative affect (R2=.12, p{\textless}.05). Additional regression analyses revealed that changes in psychological need thwarting predicted negative affect ($\delta$R2=.11, p{\textless}.05), but not positive affect ($\delta$R2=.01, p{\textgreater}.05) or subjective vitality ($\delta$R2=.04, p{\textgreater}.05) beyond contributions made by psychological need satisfaction. Conclusions: Overall, these results extend the potential utility of the PNTS-PA as an instrument for use with BPNT beyond sport and support Deci and Ryan's (2002) contentions regarding the critical role of psychological need thwarting. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Sixth grade females (N = 100) were randomly assigned to groups in a 2 x 2 (Model Type x Model Skill) factorial design or to a no-model group. In the treatment groups, subjects observed one of four unfamiliar models— (a) a skilled teacher, (b) an unskilled teacher, (c) a skilled peer, or (d) an unskilled peer—perform on the Bachman ladder task. Subjects performed 30 trials of the task and also completed self-efficacy questionnaires on three occasions. Results showed that subjects who watched a skilled model performed better than subjects who watched an unskilled model. Unlike the Landers and Landers study, no model type by model skill interaction was found. In addition, the skilled model group reported higher efficacy beliefs than the control group after performing and were more efficacious than the unskilled model subjects both after watching the model and after performing. These results suggest when students view unfamiliar models, the skill rather than the status of the model may be more salient. {\textcopyright} 1994 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review and critique the variety of definitions, concepts, and theories of psychological resilience. To this end, the narrative is divided into three main sections. The first considers how resilience has been defined in the psychology research literature. Despite the construct being operationalized in a variety of ways, most definitions are based around two core concepts: adversity and positive adaptation. A substantial body of evidence suggests that resilience is required in response to different adversities, ranging from ongoing daily hassles to major life events, and that positive adaptation must be conceptually appropriate to the adversity examined in terms of the domains assessed and the stringency of criteria used. The second section examines the conceptualization of resilience as either a trait or a process, and explores how it is distinct from a number of related terms. Resilience is conceptualized as the interactive influence of psychological characteristics within the context of the stress process. The final section reviews the theories of resilience and critically examines one theory in particular that is commonly cited in the resilience literature. Future theories in this area should take into account the multiple demands individuals encounter, the meta-cognitive and -emotive processes that affect the resilience-stress relationship, and the conceptual distinction between resilience and coping. The review concludes with implications for policy, practice, and research including the need to carefully manage individuals' immediate environment, and to develop the protective and promotive factors that individuals can proactively use to build resilience.},

abstract = {A common expectation of avalanche education is that it should reduce the frequency of avalanche deaths. But is this expectation realistic? After all, education campaigns aimed at reducing unsafe sex, illegal drug use, unsafe driving and other risky behaviors have met with very limited success, and in some cases have even worsened the problems they were intended to solve. This paper reviews why some health and safety campaigns are effective, why some aren?t, and what this means for avalanche education. A common feature of campaigns that fail is that they assume that recipi- ents? will react to hazard information, skills instruction, or advertising schemes by behaving more conser- vatively. This assumption is based on largely incorrect beliefs about how people make decisions in the face of risk. In contrast, campaigns that succeed focus on risk management, and provide recipients with simple tools like risk ladders and mitigation measures. Some of these elements are already present in avalanche education, some are emerging, and others remain to be added or modified from existing ap- proaches. Properly implemented, the lessons of health and safety education provide an opportunity for avalanche education to succeed where other programs have failed.},

abstract = {Clinical judgments and decisions are an integral component of nurse work and nurses are increasingly being challenged to account for their judgments and decisions. Nursing research is needed to help explain judgment and decision making in nursing, but most research in this area is almost exclusively characterized by descriptive studies. This article describes the use of the factorial survey method, which combines the explanatory power of a factorial experiment with the benefits of a sample survey. This hybrid technique is an excellent method for studying judgments and decisions across settings, roles, disciplines, and countries. This article outlines the steps of the method and demonstrates its applicability with an exemplar from a study across nurses from 3 countries. R ESEARCH designs that can attribute causal explanation when studying nurses' judgments and decision making are critical. The increased emphasis on continu-ity of care, interdisciplinary research, and the impact of globalization of healthcare have increased the need for research comparisons across settings, practice roles, cultures, and countries. Yet, high costs, the nature of the research, time constraints, and ethical con-cerns have hampered the use of experimental designs in nursing research on judgments, decision making, and comparative studies. Clinical judgments and decisions are an in-[QA1]},

abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this research was to develop the Sport Commitment Questionnaire-2 (SCQ-2) and establish its psychometric properties. The SCQ-2 measures the updated Sport Commitment Model (SCM: Scanlan, Russell, Scanlan, Klunchoo, {\&} Chow, 2013) and replaces the outdated Sport Commitment Questionnaire (SCQ) that assessed the original SCM (Scanlan, Simons, Carpenter, Schmidt, {\&} Keeler, 1993). Design: Based on prior commitment research, items were generated to refine and expand the original SCQ subscales and to measure new candidate constructs to the SCM. A multiphase study was then conducted. Methods: Phase 1 participants were 753 male/female adolescent athletes (ages 13-19 years) from six sports representing varying levels of task interdependence. Using similar methodology as Phase 1, Phase 2 assessed 982 male/female adolescent athletes. Results: Exploratory factor analysis of Phase 1 data revealed 13 factors: two types of commitment (Enthusiastic and Constrained) and 11 sources. Confirmatory factor analysis of Phase 2 data supported a 58-item, 12-factor structure. In addition, all subscales were internally consistent. Structural equation modeling revealed that the sources explained 81.8{\%} of the variance in Enthusiastic Commitment and 63.9{\%} in Constrained Commitment. Conclusions: The SCQ-2 assesses the sources and types of commitment in the updated SCM. Based on several indices of fit and the composite reliabilities, psychometric support for the SCQ-2 was established. One significant way to move the science and practice forward in any field is to develop effective measurement tools. The primary objective of this project was to produce a sound, up to date, ecologically valid assessment instrument to advance research in sport commitment and for use as an intervention aid by applied sport psychologists. To this end, we have added to the existing knowledge base in two ways. First, we have updated and refined our previous quantitative instrument to assess the new Sport Commitment Model (SCM) with its significant additions and re-finements to the original theoretical model of sport commitment. Second, through the process of quantifying the model constructs using what we have learned in our qualitative interview research, we have sharpened the assessment and deepened the under-standing of commitment. The specific purpose of this research was to develop the Sport Commitment Questionnaire-2 (SCQ-2) and establish its psycho-metric properties. The SCQ-2 measures the updated SCM and re-places the first Sport Commitment Questionnaire (SCQ) developed almost 25 years ago. The project used a multiphase design and studied two separate, and large heterogeneous samples of adoles-cent athletes. The SCQ-2 includes 13 subscales, consisting of two types of psychological commitment and 11 sources. Benefitting from the quantitative studies of many scientists and our mixed-methods research, the SCQ-2 captures the commitment process in a more},

abstract = {Retrospective reports of personal events constitute the principal data source for much applied social science research. Such reports are known to be subject to biases and errors of inference. In health surveys, for example, events associated with chronic conditions are particularly likely to be under‐reported (Jabine, 1987). In this series of studies we apply perspectives and tools from psychological studies of memory to the problem of understanding and improving reports of past untilization of health care. In two studies we found that subjects report using different strategies to answer questions about how often they have seen a doctor over the past 12 months, depending on the type of doctor's visit and its frequency. A third study, in which subjects' recall was checked against medical records, provided evidence that individual health events within a group of recurring, similar events are much less likely than non‐recurring events to be recalled. In Experiment 4 we tested the efficacy of cognitively oriented intervention techniques designed to (1) help subjects decompose their molar memories of groups of similar events into individual events and (2) place all remembered health events into a personal timeline. The intervention more than doubled the proportion of recurring events on the medical record that was recalled. In addition, the proportion of events that could be dated, and the accuracy of dates provided, both rose. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1991 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd},

abstract = {Gray (1981, 1982) holds that 2 general motivational systems underlie behavior and affect: a behav-ioral inhibition system (BIS) and a behavioral activation system (BAS). Self-report scales to assess dispositional BIS and BAS sensitivities were created. Scale development (Study 1) and convergent and discriminant validity in the form of correlations with alternative measures are reported (Study 2). In Study 3, a situation in which Ss anticipated a punishment was created. Controlling for initial nervousness, Ss high in BIS sensitivity (assessed earlier) were more nervous than those low. In Study 4, a situation in which Ss anticipated a reward was created. Controlling for initial happiness, Ss high in BAS sensitivity (Reward Responsiveness and Drive scales) were happier than those low. In each case the new scales predicted better than an alternative measure. Discussion is focused on conceptual implications. The past several years have seen renewed interest in physio-logical models of personality. Of course, Hans Eysenck (e.g., Eysenck, 1967) has long held that two basic dimensions of per-sonality (extraversion and emotionality) reflect differences in the functioning of two aspects of the nervous system. In more recent years, more has been learned about brain functioning, and others have incorporated the newer information into their own views of personality.

abstract = {This article proposes a new approach to factor analysis and structural equation modeling using Bayesian analysis. The new approach replaces parameter specifications of exact zeros with approximate zeros based on informative, small-variance priors. It is argued that this produces an analysis that better reflects substantive theories. The proposed Bayesian approach is particularly beneficial in applications where parameters tu-e added to a conventional model such that a nonidentified model is obtained if maximum-likelihood estimation is applied. This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus. The real-data analyses use data from Holzinger and Swineford's (1939) classic mental abilities study, Big Five personality factor data from a British survey, and science achievement data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.},

abstract = {Tested the hypothesis that learned helplessness can be induced through modeling and that the effects are mediated by perceived similarity in competence. 40 male college students observed a model fail at anagram tasks under variations in perceived similarity. Ss who perceived the unsuccessful model to be of comparable ability and those given no competence feedback persisted less throughout the tasks than Ss who perceived the model as less competent than themselves and control Ss who did not observe a model. The latter 2 groups did not differ in their initial level of persistence, but their performances diverged on succeeding trials, with Ss who perceived themselves as more competent than the model showing higher persistence. A similar pattern of results was obtained for the effects of perceived similarity on Ss' expectations of self-efficacy. A microanalysis revealed that regardless of treatment condition, the higher the Ss' expected efficacy, the longer they persisted. The strength of this relationship increased over trials, suggesting that Ss came to rely more heavily on their judgments of self-efficacy in regulating their expenditure of effort as the experiment progressed.

Their relationship to each other, as well as to measures of affect, were examined. There was considerable overlap in the two measures of perfectionism. Frost et al.'s Total Perfectionism score appears to reflect a global dimension of perfectionism which is correlated with Hewitt and Flett's Self-Oriented and Socially-Prescribed scales, and less closely related to the Other-Oriented scale. Frost et al.'s Personal Standards scale was most closely associated with Hewitt and Flett's Self-Oriented Perfectionism scale. Frost et al.'s Concern over Mistakes, Parental Expectations and Parental Criticism scales were independently correlated with Hewitt and Flett's Socially-Prescribed Perfectionism scale. The subscales from each measure showed differential relationships with measures of positive and negative affect. Those dimensions which have been found to be related to symptoms of psychopathology were most closely related to negative affect (e.g. Concern over Mistakes, Socially- Prescribed Perfectionism), while those which have been found to be related to more "healthy" characteristics were associated with positive affect (e.g. Personal Standards, Other-Oriented Perfectionism). A factor analysis using the 9 subscales resulted in a conceptually clean two-factor solution. The first of these reflected maladaptive evaluation concerns, and the second reflected positive achievement strivings. The implications of these findings for the understanding of the construct of perfectionism are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Termination of the PhD trajectory can lead to individual stress, a loss of valuable time and resources invested in the candidate and can also mean a loss of competitive advantage. Using data from two studies of doctoral candidates in the Netherlands, we take a closer look at PhD duration and delay in doctoral completion. Specifically, we address the question: Is it possible to predict which PhD candidates will experience delays in the completion of their doctorate degree? If so, it might be possible to take steps to shorten or even prevent delay, thereby helping to enhance university competitiveness.

Conscientiousness was a stronger predictor of GPA at higher levels of intelligence, suggesting that an industrious disposition serves a catalytic function among those students who are the most intellectually able. Conscientiousness was a stronger predictor of GPA at lower levels of autonomous motivation, suggesting that an industrious disposition also serves a compensatory function among those students who are the least intrinsically interested.

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that both personality and motivation are important factors in student academic performance. This study examined how the interactions between the Big Five personality traits and self-determination motivation orientations affect students' academic performance. The hypotheses were empirically tested using cross-sectional data collected from 249 primary school students in China. The correlation analysis found that self-determined motivation and four of the five personality traits (not emotional instability) were significantly positively related to academic performance in English. The hierarchical regression analysis revealed that, after controlling for gender, openness to new experience and conscientiousness both positively predicted English performance. Significant interaction effects were found between agreeableness and self-determined motivation, and between conscientiousness and self-determined motivation. However, conscientiousness and agreeableness only positively predicted academic performance when the student's self-determined motivation was low.},

abstract = {This study examines the construct validity of an original self-report instrument for the assessment of mental toughness: the Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ). Two independent studies supported a three-factor (Confidence, Constancy, and Control) 14-item model for the SMTQ. With a sample of 633 athletes (427 males, 206 females; M age = 21.5 years; SD = 5.48), drawn from 25 sport classifications, and competing at international, national, county and provincial, or club and regional standards, the first study utilized item development and exploratory factor analytic techniques to establish the psychometric properties of the SMTQ. Study 2 employed confirmatory factor analytic techniques with an independent sample of 509 sports performers (351 males, 158 females; M age = 20.2 years; SD = 3.35), competing at the aforementioned standards, and representative of 26 sports. Confirmatory analysis using structural equation modeling confirmed the overall structure. A single factor underlying mental toughness (Gmt) was identified with higher-order exploratory factor analysis using the Schmid-Leiman procedure. Collectively, satisfying absolute and incremental fit-index benchmarks, the inventory was shown to possess satisfactory psychometric properties, with adequate reliability, divergent validity, and discriminative power. The results revealed promising features of the SMTQ, lending preliminary support to the instrument's factorial validity and reliability. Further construct validation of the SMTQ is recommended, including its use as an index for evaluating the effect of intervention programs.},

Design: In two studies, a cross-sectional design was employed. In Study 1, ocean rowers were compared to age-matched controls. In Study 2, mountaineers were compared to two control groups, one of which was controlled for the amount of time spent away from home. Methods: In Study 1, 20 rowers completed measures of alexithymia and interpersonal control before rowing across the Atlantic Ocean. They were also interviewed about the emotional and agentic changes that had occurred as a consequence of completing the ocean row. In Study 2, 24 mountaineers and the two control groups (n=27 and n=26) completed measures of alexithymia and interpersonal agency. Results: In both studies, high-risk sportspeople had greater difficulty in describing their emotions. The lowest interpersonal agency was in loving partner relationships. Conclusions: Participants of prolonged engagement high-risk sports have difficulty with their emotions and have particular difficulty feeling emotionally agentic in close relationships. They participate in the high-risk activity with the specific aim of being an agent of their emotions. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The engagement due to the enjoyment of an activity is often called intrinsic motivation. Besides this understanding of intrinsic motivation, other conceptions are presented (self-determination, experience of competence, interest and involvement, mean-end-correspondence, learning-goal orientation). In doing so, the problem became evident, that the term intrinsic motivation refers to different, even conflicting conceptions. With the “Extended Cognitive Model of Motivation” different aspects of motivation are theoretically integrated. Instead of using the term intrinsic motivation, we use the term activity-related motivation. Qualitative and quantitative ways to measure activity-related incentives are outlined. Finally we present an intensively studied activity-related incentive, i.e., the experience of flow.},

The goal of this study was to examine whether subtypes of perfectionism are distinctively associated with subjective well-being (i.e., positive affect, subjective vitality, and life-satisfaction) in the sport domain. Showing that pure SOP is associated with either better (Hypothesis 1a), worse (Hy-pothesis 1b), or equivalent (Hypothesis 1c) psychological outcomes (compared to nonperfectionism) would respectively support the potentially healthy, unhealthy, and neutral nature of SOP. Conversely to prior literature, pure SPP is hypothesized to be the most damaging subtype of perfectionism in the 2 ϫ 2 model of perfectionism (Hy-pothesis 2). As such, the tenets of the 2 ϫ 2 model differ from the literature by suggesting that mixed perfectionism is potentially less harmful compared to a subtype of pure SPP (Hypothesis 3), but potentially more harmful compared to a pure SOP (Hypothesis 4). Results of moderated multiple regression analyses have shown that pure SOP is associated with equally high levels of positive affect and vitality, and to significantly higher levels of life-satisfaction compared to nonperfectionism. Further-more, pure SPP was associated with significantly lower levels of positive affect, vitality, and life-satisfaction compared to other subtypes of perfectionism. This study provided initial support for most of the hypotheses of the 2 ϫ 2 model of perfectionism in the sport domain.},

The Competitive Orientation Inventory (COI), the Sport Orientation Questionnaire (SOQ), the Perception of Success Questionnaire (POSQ), and the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) were completed in counterbalanced order. Results showed that the COI is unrelated to the other three measures. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that only the TEOSQ data adequately fit its hypothesized model. Gender differences were found but with no consistent pattern with prior research. Track and field athletes were found to have significantly higher task orientations than the competitors from other sports. The findings indicate that the TEOSQ is the better instrument for measuring achievement orientations.

Whithin the mechanized ski industry, an effective risk management and loss prevention plan, including a rescue plan, needs to be in place to ensure safe travel within avalanche terrain. Mike Wiegele Helicopter Skiing (MWHS) employs a proven 5 Step Checklist System for snow stability rating and avalanche danger forecasting. This focuses our decision making for safe terrain selection and guiding procedures. The ability to travel safely in avalanche terrain relies on early detection, forewarning and methodological gatherin of information of avalanche danger prior to heading into the mountains and before descending down each ski run. The purpose and goal of the 5-Step Checklist is to provide a systematic approach for safe travel in the mountains. It methodically provides information pertinent to analyses and intepretation of reasonable and accurate snow stability ratings and avalanche danger forecasting in a particular ski region and for specific slopes, where backcountry skiers are exposed to potential avalanches during their climb to the high apine terrain and their descent to the valley floor. The information and procedures laid out in this paper can help shape a better international avalanche standard of safety and practices throughout the ski industry and the world.},

abstract = {Perfectionism has been conceptualized as a personality variable that underlies a variety of psychological difficulties. Recently, however, theorists and researchers have begun to distinguish between two distinct types of perfectionism, one a maladaptive form that results in emotional distress, and a second form that is relatively benign, perhaps even adaptive. In this study, we compared varying models of the perfectionism construct using the best known measures of perfectionism. In a sample of 198 students, three competing models of perfectionism were examined using confirmatory factor analysis. A model that incorporated two factors, one corresponding to maladaptive perfectionism and the other adaptive perfectionism, was a better fit to the data than a unitary perfectionism model. We also examined the relations of the two types of perfectionism, Maladaptive Evaluative Concerns and Positive Striving, to a well known measure of psychological distress. Maladaptive Evaluative Concerns was more strongly associated with depression, anxiety, stress, and test taking anxiety. Overall, this study supports the validity of a distinction between two types of perfectionism, and points to the importance of this duality for measurement and research on perfectionism. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The identification of distinctive and overlapping features of anxiety and depression remains an important scientific problem. Currently, the literature does not allow to determine stable similarities and differences in the use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) in anxiety and depression, especially concerning the adaptive strategies. Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify the overlapping and distinctive patterns of CERS use in the recently proposed types of anxiety and depression in a general population. In this dimensional approach, types of anxiety and depression are considered as personality types and distinguished based on their specific structural composition and functional role (reactive or regulative) in stimulation processing. 1,632 participants from a representative sample completed the Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire (measuring the Arousal and Apprehension Types of anxiety and the Valence and Anhedonic Types of depression) and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Regression analyses were conducted with the affective types as predictors. The co-occurrence of the types was accounted for in order to examine their independent relationships with the CERS. We found that reactive arousal anxiety was not related to any strategies, while regulative apprehension anxiety primarily predicted the use of rumination, which is presumably related to the type's cognitive structural components. The strategy specific to reactive valence depression was other-blame (as predicted by the high negative affect in its structure), and the regulative, most structurally complex anhedonic depression predicted the use of the largest number of strategies, including the adaptive ones. The relationships between the types of depression and self-blame and refocus on planning were moderated by sex but the effects were small. These findings fit into the current trend of exploring the shared and specific features of anxiety and depression, which might facilitate their differentiation by identifying CERS that are characteristic for the specific types. This information can be used for supporting diagnosis and targeting selected strategies in therapy both in clinical and non-clinical populations.},

A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even non-linear models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.},

abstract = {This article presents a systematic review of the literature examining the relation-ship between self-talk and performance. " Second-generation questions " regarding potential mediators and moderators of the self-talk–performance relationship were also examined. A total of 47 studies were analyzed. Results indicated beneficial effects of positive, instructional, and motivational self-talk for performance. Some-what surprisingly, two evidence-based challenges to popular current viewpoints on self-talk emerged. First, negative self-talk did not impede performance. Second, there was inconsistent evidence for the differential effects of instructional and motivational self-talk based on task characteristics. Results from the mediation-based analysis indicate that cognitive and behavioral factors had the most consistent relationships with self-talk. The findings are discussed in the context of recent theoretical advances, and the article includes recommendations for future research (e.g., the use of designs allowing the testing of meditational hypotheses) and for current applied practice (e.g., avoiding the use of thought-stopping techniques).},

abstract = {Approximately 60{\%} of military personnel who experience mental health problems do not seek help, yet many of them could benefit from professional treatment. Across military studies, one of the most frequently reported barriers to help-seeking for mental health problems is concerns about stigma. It is, however, less clear how stigma influences mental health service utilization. This review will synthesize existing research on stigma, focusing on those in the military with mental health problems. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies between 2001 and 2014 to examine the prevalence of stigma for seeking help for a mental health problem and its association with help-seeking intentions/mental health service utilization. Twenty papers met the search criteria. Weighted prevalence estimates for the 2 most endorsed stigma concerns were 44.2{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 37.1, 51.4) for "My unit leadership might treat me differently" and 42.9{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 36.8, 49.0) for "I would be seen as weak." Nine studies found no association between anticipated stigma and help-seeking intentions/mental health service use and 4 studies found a positive association. One study found a negative association between self-stigma and intentions to seek help. Counterintuitively, those that endorsed high anticipated stigma still utilized mental health services or were interested in seeking help. We propose that these findings may be related to intention-behavior gaps or methodological issues in the measurement of stigma. Positive associations may be influenced by modified labeling theory. Additionally, other factors such as self-stigma and negative attitudes toward mental health care may be worth further attention in future investigation.},

In this commentary our aims include: reflecting on the utility and strengths of SDT as such a general framework and responding to the various contributions in this issue regarding their use of SDT as a guiding, complementary, or contrasting framework. Methods and Results: We describe how SDT has developed organically and conservatively from “within” based on the emerging patterns of evidence, as well through the ongoing challenges from other models and frameworks. We then discuss each of the various contributions to this special issue, addressing themes that include SDT's breadth of methods, and its relevance to topics such as narcissism, wisdom, individual differences, Big-Five traits, and the neuropsychology of motivation, among others. Across these discussions, we highlight fruitful avenues for research and cross-fertilization across the fields of personality, development, motivation, and neuroscience. At the same time, we counter some claims made about SDT, and forward certain cautions regarding the integration of SDT and other personality frameworks and models. Conclusions: We conclude by revisiting the value of broad theory, and SDT in particular, for coordinating complex research findings concerning motivation, personality development and wellness across multiple levels of analysis and, perhaps more importantly, for pointing researchers to the right questions within today's prolific empiricism.},

High threat-appraisal information was by far the most powerful predictor of intentions to take precautionary measures against skin cancer. Coping appraisal information was associated with reduced perceptions of hopelessness concerning skin cancer risk. Individual-difference variables (i.e., appearance concern, need for cognition, health locus of control) predicted maladaptive coping modes and, to a lesser extent, adaptive behavioral intentions. Results suggest that tailoring persuasive appeals to individuals may modestly improve preventive efforts, and that invoking perceived threat effectively motivates most people.},

Stage 3 had 518 athletes complete a provisional Sport Emotion Questionnaire (SEQ) before competition. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a 22-item and 5-factor structure provided acceptable model fit. Results from Stage 4 supported the criterion validity of the SEQ.

This study analyzed the relationship among resilient qualities and coping strategies in 235 Spanish athletes (126 males, 109 females; M age ¼ 20.7 yr) who practiced different sports (79.1{\%} team sports, 20.9{\%} individual sports). They were evaluated at the beginning of the last competitive mesocycle and after an important competition. Coping strategies and level of resilient qualities were measured by the Coping Inventory for Competitive Sport and the Resilience Scale. There was no significant difference in resilience scores between evaluations performed during the last mesocycle or competition. A significant increase occurred in the scores for emotion-oriented and distraction-oriented coping during competition. Resilience scores correlated positively to task-oriented coping and negatively to disengagement-and distraction-oriented coping during both periods. Analysis of variance indicated that athletes with high individual resilient qualities reached higher scores in task-oriented coping, using to a lower extent disengagement-and distraction-oriented coping. Results obtained suggest that resilient characteristics may associate in athletes to the use of more potentially adaptative coping strategies.},

abstract = {Individuals with adaptive expertise possess the skills to deal with novel problems. Whereas this concept has been around since the mid-1980s, no instrument exists that provides a good operationalization of the theoretical construct. This inhibits the further development of research on adaptive expertise and the evaluation of employees' adaptive expertise levels. Adaptive expertise has been unanimously described as a composition of domain-specific and innovative skills. Some researchers argue that metacognitive skills are also crucial. This study aimed to establish whether an instrument measuring adaptive expertise is composed of these three dimensions. In addition, it was tested whether such an instrument is influenced by task variety and work experience, as previously reported in literature. A sample of 383 professionals and graduates were used to test the Adaptive Expertise Inventory. Through exploratory factor analysis (EFA), (E/CFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the quality of the instrument was evaluated. Good model fit was achieved. The final instrument consisted of two dimensions—i.e., domain-specific and innovative skills—with five items each. Regression analysis showed that not work experience, but task variety is related to level of adaptive expertise. The Adaptive Expertise Inventory proved to be a valid instrument for measuring adaptive expertise.},

abstract = {Objective: the present study was undertaken to gain a better insight into the relationship between alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) whether a depressive or anxiety disorder is associated with an elevation of one or more dimensions of alexithymia; and (2) whether alexithymia is an independent construct from depression and anxiety in patients with depressive or anxiety disorders. Method: a total of 113 patients with depressive or anxiety disorders (DSM-IV) and 113 control subjects completed the 20-item version of the Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Results: the TAS-20 total score was higher in depressed and anxious patients than in controls. This finding mainly depended on an increased score for 'difficulty identifying feelings' (DIF), and (only in depressed patients) on an increased score for 'difficulty communicating feelings' (DCF). The factor analysis of the TAS-20 and HADS items showed that depression is a construct different from alexithymia, whereas some overlap exists between anxiety and DIF dimension. Conclusion: our results suggest that in depressive and anxiety disorders, alexithymia and depression are separate constructs that may be closely related; in contrast, there are some overlaps between the DIF dimension and anxiety.

The primary conclusion of this line of research is that forecast accuracy can be substantially improved through the combination of multiple individual forecasts.

This paper provides a review and annotated bibliography of that literature, including contributions from the forecasting, psychology, statistics, and management science literatures. The objectives are to provide a guide to the literature for students and researchers and to help researchers locate contributions in specific areas, both theoretical and applied. Suggestions for future research directions include (1) examination of simple combining approaches to determine reasons for their robustness, (2) development of alternative uses of multiple forecasts in order to make better use of the information they contain, (3) use of combined forecasts as benchmarks for forecast evaluation, and (4) study of subjective combination procedures. Finally, combining forecasts should become part of the mainstream of forecasting practice. In order to achieve this, practitioners should be encouraged to combine forecasts, and software to produce combined forecasts easily should be made available. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Jeffrey Gray's Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) bridges several levels of analysis: anatomy, physiology, motivation, conditioning, personality and psychopathology. Regarding anxiety, Gray proposed that individual differences in reactivity of the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS)-a sub-system of the conceptual nervous system-not only underlies the normal personality dimension of trait anxiety/neuroticism but also underlies vulnerability to the anxiety disorders. At the anatomical level, Gray originally proposed that the septo-hippocampal system (SHS) constituted the sub-system of the central nervous system that is the seat of the BIS. Gray and McNaughton expanded the neuroanatomical seat of anxiety to include the interactions of the SHS system with the amygdala. One can derive at least three broad sets of predictions based on RST that are directly relevant for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder (MDD). First, predictions can be derived regarding the general structure of the various symptoms of the anxiety disorders. Relatedly, RST also provides a useful framework for understanding the relations of anxiety with panic and depression. Secondly, the psychopathology of the anxiety disorders should be characterized by features described by the major outputs of the BIS-an increase in arousal, behavioral inhibition and negative cognitive bias. Thirdly, trait anxiety/neuroticism should be a risk factor for the anxiety disorders and perhaps (non-psychotic) MDD as well. In this chapter, we review the available evidence regarding these three sets of predictions, identify unresolved questions concerning RST and make suggestions regarding future RST research directions.

Published litera-ture mentioning member checks was reviewed to identify the purposes and procedures for seeking feedback from research participants as well as outcomes reported from member checks. Four themes reflecting underlying assumptions about the pur-poses of research that have implications for member checks were identified: theory generalisation, representation, participa-tion, and change. Member checks are unlikely to be relevant to research focussed on theory development and generalisation.},

abstract = {Objectives: To demonstrate the use of machine-learning for reducing questionnaire response burden, we created multiple, shorter versions of the Mindfulness Inventory for Sport. We then tested the reliability and validity of scores derived from these shorter versions in athletic populations. Design: We used genetic algorithms to shorten the measure, and both cross-sectional and longitudinal data to test psychometric properties. Method: We collected data from 859 undergraduate exercise science students and 118 golfers. We used 75{\%} of the student sample to shorten the measure, and the rest of the data to test the internal consistency, test-retest reliability, content validity, and factorial validity. For criterion validity, we explored relationships between the subscales and other measures of mindfulness, golf handicaps, and an objective measure of putting accuracy. Results: Genetic algorithms efficiently generated stable solutions to shortening the measure. Reliability decreased as the measure become shorter—especially between three and two items per subscale—but remained acceptable. Validity metrics for shorter versions were as good, and sometimes better, than the full questionnaire. Awareness and refocusing subscales demonstrated weak associations with golf handicap for long and short versions. Non-judgment showed no significant associations, and no subscales significantly predicted putting performance. Conclusions: Genetic algorithms provide efficient solutions to reducing questionnaire response burden for athletes.},

Consequently, this has raised important questions regarding the criteria for judging this emerging form of inquiry. With the intent to stimulate methodological debate, this paper explores prevailing notions of validity in qualitative sport psychology by focusing on how various scholars have framed this term. The prevailing parallel perspective of validity is discussed, as are specific problems associated with this view. In contrast, recent attempts to reconceptualize validity in relation to particular forms of qualitative inquiry are considered. The socially constructed nature of validity and the multiplicity of meanings associated with this term are presented according to a diversification perspective. More radical calls to renounce validity and seek alternative criteria for judging qualitative inquiry are also discussed. In closing, the ongoing problem of criteria and its implications for research in sport psychology are considered.},

However, most of the existing algorithms only work in a centralized fashion, i.e. using the whole dataset at once. In this research a new method for distributing the feature selection process is proposed. It distributes the data by features, i.e. according to a vertical distribution, and then performs a merging procedure which updates the feature subset according to improvements in the classification accuracy. The effectiveness of our proposal is tested on microarray data, which has brought a difficult challenge for researchers due to the high number of gene expression contained and the small samples size. The results on eight microarray datasets show that the execution time is considerably shortened whereas the performance is maintained or even improved compared to the standard algorithms applied to the non-partitioned datasets.},

abstract = {This project examines protective factors associated with resilience/posttraumatic growth and risk factors associated with posttraumatic stress among firefighters exposed to critical incidents. The participants were 286 (257 men and 29 women) volunteer and paid firefighters in Whatcom County, Washington. Participants completed an anonymous survey asking about demographics, critical incident exposure, posttraumatic stress symptoms, posttraumatic growth, resource availability, coping, occupational stress and critical incident stress debriefing experience. Most participants had significant critical incident exposure, and about half had attended critical incident stress debriefing sessions. Posttraumatic growth was associated with being female, critical incident exposure, critical incident stress debriefing attendance, posttraumatic stress symptoms (negative association), occupational support, occupation satisfaction, occupational effort, problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping and personal characteristic resources. Posttraumatic stress symptoms were positively associated with years of firefighting, burnout, occupational effort and disengagement coping and negatively associated with critical incident stress debriefing attendance, posttraumatic growth, social support, internal locus of control, personal characteristic resources, energy resources and condition resources. The findings support conservation of resources stress theory and show that the maintenance and acquisition of resources can offset losses and facilitate resilience/posttraumatic growth. Implications of the findings for enhancing firefighter resources, facilitating resilience and minimizing occupational stressors are discussed.

The current investigation examines the association between grit, defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals, other individual difference variables, and retention in four different contexts: the military, workplace sales, high school, and marriage. Grit predicted retention over and beyond established context-specific predictors of retention (e.g., intelligence, physical aptitude, Big Five personality traits, job tenure) and demographic variables in each setting. Grittier soldiers were more likely to complete an Army Special Operations Forces (ARSOF) selection course, grittier sales employees were more likely to keep their jobs, grittier students were more likely to graduate from high school, and grittier men were more likely to stay married. The relative predictive validity of grit compared to other traditional predictors of retention is examined in each of the four studies. These findings suggest that in addition to domain-specific influences, there may be domain-general individual differences which influence commitment to diverse life goals over time.},

abstract = {The present article presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from four principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. The more dependable the experiential sources, the greater are the changes in perceived selfefficacy. A number of factors are identified as influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arising from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes. Possible directions for further research are discussed.},

Results indicated that placing importance on either intrinsic or extrinsic aspirations related positively to attainment of those goals. Yet, whereas attainment of intrinsic aspirations related positively to psychological health, attainment of extrinsic aspirations did not; indeed, attainment of extrinsic aspirations related positively to indicators of ill-being. Also as predicted, the association between change in attainment of intrinsic aspirations and change in psychological health was mediated by change in the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Discussion focuses on the idea that not all goal attainment is beneficial; rather, attainment of aspirations with different contents relates differentially to psychological health. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Finucane2000,
abstract = {This paper re-examines the commonly observed inverse relationship between perceived risk and perceived benefit. We propose that this relationship occurs because people rely on affect when judging the risk and benefit of specific hazards. Evidence supporting this proposal is obtained in two experimental studies. Study 1 investigated the inverse relationship between risk and benefit judgments under a time-pressure condition designed to limit the use of analytic thought and enhance the reliance on affect. As expected, the inverse relationship was strengthened when time pressure was introduced. Study 2 tested and confirmed the hypothesis that providing information designed to alter the favorability of one's overall affective evaluation of an item (say nuclear power) would systematically change the risk and benefit judgments for that item. Both studies suggest that people seem prone to using an affect heuristic which improves judgmental efficiency by deriving both risk and benefit evaluations from a common source - affective reactions to the stimulus item.

abstract = {Adolescence is a period of life in which peer relationships become increasingly important. Adolescents have a greater likelihood of taking risks when they are with peers rather than alone. In this study, we investigated the development of social influence on risk perception from late childhood through adulthood. Five hundred and sixty-three participants rated the riskiness of everyday situations and were then informed about the ratings of a social-influence group (teenagers or adults) before rating each situation again. All age groups showed a significant social-influence effect, changing their risk ratings in the direction of the provided ratings; this social-influence effect decreased with age. Most age groups adjusted their ratings more to conform to the ratings of the adult social-influence group than to the ratings of the teenager social-influence group. Only young adolescents were more strongly influenced by the teenager social-influence group than they were by the adult social-influence group, which suggests that to early adolescents, the opinions of other teenagers about risk matter more than the opinions of adults.},

Three personality variables were used, Rotter's Internal vs External Locus of Control Scale, Schwarzer's General Self-efficacy Scale and Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale. A scale asking for personal and general risk perception measured perceived risk. It was proposed that individuals low in anxiety, having an internal locus of control and high in self-efficacy should perceive general risks and personal risks higher than individuals high in anxiety and low in self-efficacy and having external locus of control should do. Fifty-nine business students responded to these three scales. The hypothesis was supported by the results and suggested that the personality measures and particularly anxiety were significantly associated to both personal and general risk perceptions.},

abstract = {DNA micro-arrays now permit scientists to screen thousands of genes simultaneously and determine whether those genes are active, hyperactive or silent in normal or cancerous tissue. Because these newmicro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues. In this paper, we address the problem of selection of a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data, recorded on DNA micro-arrays. Using available training examples from cancer and normal patients, we build a classifier suitable for genetic diagnosis, as well as drug discovery. Previous attempts to address this problem select genes with correlation techniques.We propose a newmethod of gene selection utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our techniques yield better classification performance and are biologically relevant to cancer. In contrast with the baseline method, our method eliminates gene redundancy automatically and yields better and more compact gene subsets. In patients with leukemia our method discovered 2 genes that yield zero leave- one-out error, while 64 genes are necessary for the baseline method to get the best result (one leave-one-out error). In the colon cancer database, using only 4 genes our method is 98{\%} accurate, while the baseline method is only 86{\%} accurate.},

@article{Seymour1997,
abstract = {Some of the key mathematical results are stated without proof in order to make the underlying theory accessible to a wider audience. The book assumes a knowledge only of basic calculus, matrix algebra, and elementary statistics. The emphasis is on methods and the analysis of data sets. The logic and tools of model-building for stationary and nonstationary time series are developed in detail and numerous exercises, many of which make use of the included computer package, provide the reader with ample opportunity to develop skills in this area. The core of the book covers stationary processes, ARMA and ARIMA processes, multivariate time series and state-space models, with an optional chapter on spectral analysis. Additional topics include harmonic regression, the Burg and Hannan-Rissanen algorithms, unit roots, regression with ARMA errors, structural models, the EM algorithm, generalized state-space models with applications to time series of count data, exponential smoothing, the Holt-Winters and ARAR forecasting algorithms, transfer function models and intervention analysis. Brief introductions are also given to cointegration and to nonlinear, continuous-time and long-memory models. The time series package included in the back of the book is a slightly modified version of the package ITSM, published separately as ITSM for Windows, by Springer-Verlag, 1994. It does not handle such large data sets as ITSM for Windows, but like the latter, runs on IBM-PC compatible computers under either DOS or Windows (version 3.1 or later). The programs are all menu-driven so that the reader can immediately apply the techniques in the book to time series data, with a minimal investment of time in the computational and algorithmic aspects of the analysis.},

abstract = {The physical, emotional, and financial consequences of engaging in risky sexual behavior can be extremely high. This paper explores the relations between the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality and a variety of risky sexual behaviors using a community sample of 481 individuals who are part of an ongoing longitudinal study. More specifically, we examined the relations between the five major personality domains, as well as the 30 specific facets, and six risky sexual behaviors including number of partners, the use of drugs or alcohol before or during sex, number of sexual acts without using a condom, giving birth at an early age, sex outside one's primary relationship, and early sexual initiation. The results suggest that personality can make a valuable contribution to our understanding of several risky sexual behaviors. In particular, the domains of low Agreeableness, low Openness to Experience, and high Extraversion were significantly related to multiple high risk sexual behaviors. In addition, several specific personality traits made significant contributions (e.g., high gregariousness, high excitement seeking, low openness to fantasy, low trust, and low straightforwardness). ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Many methods have been proposed of which bagging and boosting were the most popular. In this research, the idea of ensembling is adapted for feature selection. We propose an ensemble of filters for classification, aimed at achieving a good classification performance together with a reduction in the input dimensionality. With this approach, we try to overcome the problem of selecting an appropriate method for each problem at hand, as it is overly dependent on the characteristics of the datasets. The adequacy of using an ensemble of filters rather than a single filter was demonstrated on synthetic and real data, paving the way for its final application over a challenging scenario such as DNA microarray classification. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We present a psychometric scale that assesses risk taking in five content domains: financial decisions (separately for investing versus gambling), health/safety, recreational, ethical, and social decisions. Respondents rate the likelihood that they would engage in domain-specific risky activities (Part I). An optional Part II assesses respondents' perceptions of the magnitude of the risks and expected benefits of the activities judged in Part I. The scale's construct validity and consistency is evaluated for a sample of American undergraduate students. As expected, respondents' degree of risk taking was highly domain-specific, i.e. not consistently risk-averse or consistently risk-seeking across all content domains. Women appeared to be more risk-averse in all domains except social risk. A regression of risk taking (likelihood of engaging in the risky activity) on expected benefits and perceived risks suggests that gender and content domain differences in apparent risk taking are associated with differences in the perception of the activities' benefits and risk, rather than with differences in attitude towards perceived risk.

The purpose of this study was to examine whether intrateam communication mediated the effects of transformational leadership behaviors on task cohesion. Design/Methods: A cross-sectional study of university level ultimate frisbee players (N = 199). Participants completed a measure assessing their perceptions of their captain's transformational leadership behaviors. Post-competition, participants completed measures assessing perceptions of intrateam communication and task cohesion within their own team. Results: Multilevel analyses revealed intrateam communication to partially mediate the relationships between two of the transformational leadership behaviors and task cohesion. Conclusions: Intrateam communication is seen to be a mechanism that explains the relationship between transformational leadership and task cohesion. Overall, the results support and add to the range of positive effects associated with transformational leadership in sport, and are suggestive of interventions that may raise levels of team cohesion. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Method We conducted network analyses of 19 DSM and non-DSM symptoms of MD assessed at personal interview in 5952 Han Chinese women meeting DSM-IV criteria for recurrent MD. We estimated an Ising model (the state-of-the-art network model for binary data), compared the centrality (interconnectedness) of DSM-IV and non-DSM symptoms, and investigated the community structure (symptoms strongly clustered together). Results The DSM and non-DSM criteria were intermingled within the same symptom network. In both the DSM-IV and non-DSM criteria sets, some symptoms were central (highly interconnected) while others were more peripheral. The mean centrality of the DSM and non-DSM criteria sets did not significantly differ. In at least two cases, non-DSM criteria were more central than symptomatically related DSM criteria: lowered libido vs. sleep and appetite changes, and hopelessness versus worthlessness. The overall network had three sub-clusters reflecting neurovegetative/mood symptoms, cognitive changes and anxiety/irritability. Limitations The sample were severely ill Han Chinese females limiting generalizability. Conclusions Consistent with prior historical reviews, our results suggest that the DSM-IV criteria for MD reflect one possible sub-set of a larger pool of plausible depressive symptoms and signs. While the DSM criteria on average perform well, they are not unique and may not be optimal in their ability to describe the depressive syndrome.},

abstract = {Detecting deception is an inherently difficult task, but one that plays a critical role for law enforcement investigators in the interrogation room. In general, research has failed to indicate that performance in this domain is improved by training or prior experience. A signal detection framework is applied to the paradigm to better conceptualize the influence of these two factors. We found that although neither factor influenced dis-crimination accuracy, there was an effect on response bias such that training and prior experience appeared to increase the likelihood of responding " deceit " as opposed to " truth. " This " investigator bias " was observed both in a review of the literature and in this study of North American law enforcement investigators who took part in a foren-sically based deception-detection task. Possible theoretical mechanisms and practical implications of these findings are discussed. Police-induced confessions are a potent prosecutorial weapon that can have far-reaching and rippling effects on the disposition of cases and on the criminal jus-tice system as a whole. Indeed, modern police interrogations are so powerful that they have, at times, elicited coerced-compliant and -internalized false confessions from innocent people},

The Goal Orientation in Exercise Measure (GOEM) was developed to assess individuals' proneness to endorse task or ego goals. Participants included 372 males and females from 16 recreational physical activity clubs in Southeast England. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) supported the two-factor model and demonstrated invariance between sexes. Internal consistency for task and ego subscales was .78 and .88, respectively, while correlations between the goal orientations and behavioral regulations (Markland {\&} Tobin, 2004) served to provide initial evidence for the construct validity of the measure. The development of the GOEM may allow for a broader understanding of the motivational processes implicated in exercise-related domains},

abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of the two studies presented in this paper is to establish validity evidence for the Sport Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale-2 (Sport-MPS-2: Gotwals {\&} Dunn, 2009). Studies 1 and 2 are respectively focused on the production of structurally-related and external validity evidence. Methods: In Study 1, 263 male and female intercollegiate volleyball players (M age = 19.98 years) completed the Sport-MPS-2. In Study 2, 181 male intercollegiate ice hockey players (M age = 22.16 years) responded to the Sport-MPS-2, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Frost, Marten, Lahart, {\&} Rosenblate, 1990), and a modified Sport Anxiety Scale (Smith, Smoll, {\&} Schutz, 1990). Results: Exploratory factor analysis results in Study 1 revealed supportive structurally-related validity evidence for the six factors of the Sport-MPS-2. Study 2 generated supportive external validity evidence by producing anticipated moderate to large positive correlations between conceptually analogous Sport-MPS-2 and Frost-MPS subscales (all ps {\textless} .001), using canonical correlation to demonstrate that the Sport-MPS-2 was able to represent theory-based relationships between perfectionism and competitive trait anxiety (CTA), and indicating that the Sport-MPS-2-but not the Frost-MPS-was capable of identifying an anticipated link between healthy perfectionism and CTA. Conclusions: Results provide support for the continued use of the Sport-MPS-2 as a measure of multidimensional perfectionism in sport. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduction: Beyond clinical trials, clinical practice guidelines, and administrative regulation, treatment decision-making can be influenced by individual and contextual factors. Our goal was to describe variations in the patterns of initiation of anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation by Health Areas (HA) in the region of Valencia in Spain and to quantify the influence of the HAs on variations in treatment choice. Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all atrial fibrillation patients who started treatment with oral anticoagulants between November 2011 and February 2014 in each of the region's 24 HAs. We described patient and utilization characteristics per HA and initiation patterns over time, and we identified contextual and individual factors associated with differences in initiation patterns. Results: 21,879 patients initiated treatment with an oral anticoagulant in the 24 HAs. Initiation with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in the first year was 14.6{\%}. In November 2013 the ratio was 25.4{\%}, with HA ratios ranging from 3.8 to 57.1{\%}. DOAC-initiating patients had less comorbidity but were more likely to present episodes of previous ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or TIA when compared with patients initiating with VKA treatment. Variability among HAs was statistically significant, with the majority of HAs ranking above or below the regional initiation average (ICC ≈ 8{\%}). Conclusion: There was high variability in the percentage of DOAC initiation and in the choice of DOAC among HAs. Interventions aimed to improve DOAC initiation decision-making and to reduce variations should take into account the Health Area component.},

abstract = {This article examines health promotion and disease prevention from the perspective of social cognitive theory. The areas of overlap with some of the most widely applied psychosocial models of health are identified. The models of health promotion and disease prevention have undergone several generational changes. We have shifted from trying to scare people into health, to rewarding them into health, to equipping them with self-regulatory skills to manage their health habits, to shoring up their habit changes with dependable social supports. These transformations have evolved a multifaceted approach that addresses the reciprocal interplay between self-regulatory and environmental determinants of health behavior. Social cognitive theory addresses the sociostructural determinants of health as well as the personal determinants. A comprehensive approach to health promotion requires changing the practices of social systems that have widespread detrimental effects on health rather than solely changing the habits of individuals. Further progress in this field requires building new structures for health promotion, new systems for risk reduction and greater emphasis on health policy initiatives. People's beliefs in their collective efficacy to accomplish social change, therefore, play a key role in the policy and public health approach to health promotion and disease prevention.},

One of these concerns large-scale, 'global' structures, and the aim is to model the shapes, or features of the shapes, of distributions. The other concerns small-scale, 'local' structures, and the aim is to detect these anomalies and decide if they are real or chance occurrences. In the context of signal detection in the pharmaceutical sector, most interest lies in the second of the above two aspects; however, signal detection occurs relative to an assumed background model, therefore, some discussion of the first aspect is also necessary.

abstract = {This paper shows some of the adverse effects that can occur when plausible values are not used or are used incorrectly during analysis of large-scale survey data. To ensure that the uncertainty associated with measures of skills in largescale surveys is properly taken into account, researchers need to follow the procedures outlined in the article and in more detail in, for example, Little and Rubin (1987) and Schafer (1997). There is no need to rely on computational shortcuts by averaging plausible values before calculations: analytical shortcuts such as averaging plausible values produce biased estimates and should be discouraged. All analyses using survey assessment results need not only use the data as provided by the different assessment organizations but also adhere to the appropriate procedures described in this article and the included references, as well as in the guides provided for users of international survey assessment databases.},

@article{Dohmen2005,
abstract = {This paper presents new evidence on the distribution of risk attitudes in the population, using a novel set of survey questions and a representative sample of roughly 22,000 individuals living in Germany. Using a question that asks about willingness to take risks on an 11-point scale, we find evidence of heterogeneity across individuals, and show that willingness to take risks is negatively related to age and being female, and positively related to height and parental education. We test the behavioral relevance of this survey measure by conducting a complementary field experiment, based on a representative sample of 450 subjects, and find that the measure is a good predictor of actual risk-taking behavior. We then use a more standard lottery question to measure risk preference, and find similar results regarding heterogeneity and determinants of risk preferences. The lottery question makes it possible to estimate the coefficient of relative risk aversion for each individual in the sample. Using five questions about willingness to take risks in specific domains — car driving, financial matters, sports and leisure, career, and health — the paper also studies the impact of context on risk attitudes, finding a strong but imperfect correlation across contexts. Using data on a collection of risky behaviors from different contexts, including traffic offenses, portfolio choice, smoking, occupational choice, participation in sports, and migration, the paper compares the predictive power of all of the risk measures. Strikingly, the general risk question predicts all behaviors whereas the standard lottery measure does not. The best overall predictor for any specific behavior is typically the corresponding context-specific measure. These findings call into the question the current preoccupation with lottery measures of risk preference, and point to variation in risk perceptions as an understudied determinant of risky behavior.},

In contrast, the results from alternative individually weighted regression models provided strong support for the importance hypothesis. These alternative models utilized idiographically determined as opposed to nomothetically determined relative importance. The data also showed evidence of strong discounting for certain domains, moderate discounting for other domains, and no discounting for still others.

This review analyzes whether realization of goal intentions is facilitated by forming an implementation intention that spells out the when, where, and how of goal striving in advance (“If situation Y is encountered, then I will initiate goal‐directed behavior X!”). Findings from 94 independent tests showed that implementation intentions had a positive effect of medium‐to‐large magnitude (d = .65) on goal attainment. Implementation intentions were effective in promoting the initiation of goal striving, the shielding of ongoing goal pursuit from unwanted influences, disengagement from failing courses of action, and conservation of capability for future goal striving. There was also strong support for postulated component processes: Implementation intention formation both enhanced the accessibility of specified opportunities and automated respective goal‐directed responses. Several directions for future research are outlined.},

Affective and continuance commitment generally correlated as expected with their hypothesized antecedent variables; no unique antecedents of normative commitment were identified. Also, as expected, all three forms of commitment related negatively to withdrawal cognition and turnover, and affective commitment had the strongest and most favorable correlations with organization-relevant (attendance, performance, and organizational citizenship behavior) and employee-relevant (stress and work–family conflict) outcomes. Normative commitment was also associated with desirable outcomes, albeit not as strongly. Continuance commitment was unrelated, or related negatively, to these outcomes. Comparisons of studies conducted within and outside North America revealed considerable similarity yet suggested that more systematic primary research concerning cultural differences is warranted.},

abstract = {The identification of distinctive and overlapping features of anxiety and depression remains an important scientific problem. Currently, the literature does not allow to determine stable similarities and differences in the use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERS) in anxiety and depression, especially concerning the adaptive strategies. Consequently, the aim of this study was to identify the overlapping and distinctive patterns of CERS use in the recently proposed types of anxiety and depression in a general population. In this dimensional approach, types of anxiety and depression are considered as personality types and distinguished based on their specific structural composition and functional role (reactive or regulative) in stimulation processing. 1,632 participants from a representative sample completed the Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire (measuring the Arousal and Apprehension Types of anxiety and the Valence and Anhedonic Types of depression) and the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Regression analyses were conducted with the affective types as predictors. The co-occurrence of the types was accounted for in order to examine their independent relationships with the CERS. We found that reactive arousal anxiety was not related to any strategies, while regulative apprehension anxiety primarily predicted the use of rumination, which is presumably related to the type's cognitive structural components. The strategy specific to reactive valence depression was other-blame (as predicted by the high negative affect in its structure), and the regulative, most structurally complex anhedonic depression predicted the use of the largest number of strategies, including the adaptive ones. The relationships between the types of depression and self-blame and refocus on planning were moderated by sex but the effects were small. These findings fit into the current trend of exploring the shared and specific features of anxiety and depression, which might facilitate their differentiation by identifying CERS that are characteristic for the specific types. This information can be used for supporting diagnosis and targeting selected strategies in therapy both in clinical and non-clinical populations.},

abstract = {Objectives: This study examined the impact of body mass and body image on autonomous motivation for exercise among adolescents. It was predicted that body mass and body size discrepancies would be curvilinearly related to relative autonomy because, from a self-determination theory perspective, being or perceiving that one is under- or over-sized would be experienced as pressure to conform to culturally transmitted standards of an ideal physique, undermining one's sense of autonomy. Design: Cross-sectional comparative study. Methods: Fifty males (mean age 16.90) and 48 females (mean age 16.88) completed measures of relative autonomy for exercise, discrepancies between perceived and ideal body size, body mass index and physical activity. Results: Hierarchical polynomial regression analyses showed that among males relative autonomy was predicted by both body mass and body size discrepancies. The relationships took an inverted-u form: autonomy was at its maximum when body mass index was around 18.50 and when body size discrepancies were zero. Among females, relative autonomy was predicted by body size discrepancies alone and the relationship was r-shaped: autonomy increased as body size discrepancies became less negative, reaching a maximum and leveling off when the discrepancy was +1. Conclusions: The gender difference in the effect of body mass and perceived body size discrepancies on autonomous motivation for exercise could be explained by different socio-cultural expectations for males and females in Western societies. For females the cultural norm is a thin and toned physique whereas for males it is a muscular mesomorphic build that is neither thin nor fat. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Respondents completed Schwartz's Portrait Values Questionnaire (Schwartz, Melech, Lehmann, Burgess, {\&} Harris, 2001) and measures of self-esteem and perceived and received support. The values explained more than twice the variance for perceived compared with received support, with those scoring high on stimulation, hedonism and benevolence, and low on tradition, conformity and security, reporting greater perceived support. In path analyses, values significantly predicted perceived support and perceived support predicted self-esteem, but there was no direct relationship between values and self-esteem. These findings are discussed in the light of current debates on the role of values in the promotion of prosocial behaviour.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose: What drives some athletes to achieve at the highest level whilst other athletes fail to achieve their physical potential? Why does the 'fire' burn so brightly for some elite athletes and not for others? A good understanding of an athlete's motivation is critical to a coach designing an appropriate motivational climate to realize an athlete's physical talent. This paper examines the motivational processes of elite athletes within the framework of three major social-cognitive theories of motivation. Method: Participants were five male and five female elite track and field athletes from Australia who had finished in the top ten at either the Olympic Games and/or the World Championships in the last six years. Qualitative data were collected using semi-structured interviews. Results and Discussion: Inductive analyses revealed several major themes associated with the motivational processes of elite athletes: (a) they were highly driven by personal goals and achievement, (b) they had strong self-belief, and (c) track and field was central to their lives. The findings are discussed in light of recent social-cognitive theories of motivation, namely, self-determination theory, the hierarchical model of motivation, and achievement goal theory. Self-determined forms of motivation characterised the elite athletes in this study and, consistent with social-cognitive theories of motivation, it is suggested that goal accomplishment enhances perceptions of competence and consequently promotes self-determined forms of motivation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This article provides a concrete example of applied qualitative research using CR as a philosophical and methodological framework. Drawing examples from a study of Canadian farm women's experiences with agricultural policy, I suggest a flexible deductive process of coding and data analysis that is consistent with CR ontology and epistemology. The paper follows the typical stages of qualitative research while demonstrating the application of methods informed by CR at each stage. Important considerations CR ontology and epistemology raise, such as the use of existing theory and critical engagement with participants' knowledge and experience, are discussed throughout. Ultimately, I identify two key causal mechanisms shaping the lives of farm women and suggest a future direction for feminist political economy theory to more effectively analyze women's work in agricultural contexts.},

The aim of the current study was to identify the motivational, volitional, and implicit antecedents of parents' sun-protective behaviors based on an Integrated Behavior Change model. Method: Parents (N = 373) of 2- to 5-year-old children self-reported their intentions, attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, autonomous and controlled motivation, action plans, habit, and past behaviors with respect to sun-protective behaviors for their children. Two weeks later (n = 273), the parents self-reported their participation in sun-protective behaviors for their child. Results: Data were analyzed using variance-based structural equation modeling. Results showed significant direct effects of attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and past behavior on intentions, and significant direct effects of autonomous motivation, perceived behavioral control, intentions, action planning, habit, and past behavior on parents' participation in sun-protective behaviors for their child. There were also significant total indirect effects of autonomous motivation on intentions mediated by attitudes and subjective norm. Conclusions: Current results indicate that parents' sun-protective behaviors toward their children are a function of motivational (autonomous motivation, intentions), volitional (action planning), and implicit (habit) factors. The findings from the current study provide formative data to inform the development of behavior change interventions to increase parents' participation in sun-protective behaviors for their children.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Four studies were conducted with two primary objectives: (i) to conceptualize and measure mental toughness from a behavioral perspective; and (ii) to apply relevant personality theory to the examination of between-person differences in mentally tough behavior. METHOD: Studies 1 (n = 305) and 2 (n = 110) focused on the development of an informant-rated mental toughness questionnaire that assessed individual differences in ability to maintain or enhance performance under pressure from a wide range of stressors. Studies 3 (n = 214) and 4 (n = 196) examined the relationship between reinforcement sensitivities and mentally tough behavior. RESULTS: The highest levels of mental toughness reported by coaches occurred when performers were sensitive to punishment and insensitive to reward. Study 4 suggested that such performers are predisposed to identify threatening stimuli early which gives them the best possible opportunity to prepare an effective response to the pressurized environments they encounter. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that high level cricketers who are punishment sensitive, but not reward sensitive, detect threat early and can maintain goal directed behavior under pressure from a range of different stressors.},

Data are available from the first author, code for the program Mplus is provided, and tables illustrate how to present Bayesian results. In conclusion, the many benefits and few hindrances of Bayesian methods are discussed, where the major hindrance has been an easily solvable lack of familiarity by organizational researchers.},

abstract = {With increasing access to population-based data and electronic health records for secondary analysis, missing data are common. In the social and behavioral sciences, missing data frequently are handled with multiple imputation methods or full information maximum likelihood (FIML) techniques, but healthcare researchers have not embraced these methodologies to the same extent and more often use either traditional imputation techniques or complete case analysis, which can compromise power and introduce unintended bias. This article is a review of options for handling missing data, concluding with a case study demonstrating the utility of multilevel structural equation modeling using full information maximum likelihood (MSEM with FIML) to handle large amounts of missing data. MSEM with FIML is a parsimonious and hypothesis-driven strategy to cope with large amounts of missing data without compromising power or introducing bias. This technique is relevant for nurse researchers faced with ever-increasing amounts of electronic data and decreasing research budgets. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Missing items are common in quality of life (QoL) questionnaires and present a challenge for research in this field. It remains unclear which of the various methods proposed to deal with missing data performs best in this context. We compared personal mean score, full information maximum likelihood, multiple imputation, and hot deck techniques using various realistic simulation scenarios of item missingness in QoL questionnaires constructed within the framework of classical test theory. METHODS: Samples of 300 and 1,000 subjects were randomly drawn from the 2003 INSEE Decennial Health Survey (of 23,018 subjects representative of the French population and having completed the SF-36) and various patterns of missing data were generated according to three different item non-response rates (3, 6, and 9{\%}) and three types of missing data (Little and Rubin's "missing completely at random," "missing at random," and "missing not at random"). The missing data methods were evaluated in terms of accuracy and precision for the analysis of one descriptive and one association parameter for three different scales of the SF-36. RESULTS: For all item non-response rates and types of missing data, multiple imputation and full information maximum likelihood appeared superior to the personal mean score and especially to hot deck in terms of accuracy and precision; however, the use of personal mean score was associated with insignificant bias (relative bias {\textless}2{\%}) in all studied situations. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas multiple imputation and full information maximum likelihood are confirmed as reference methods, the personal mean score appears nonetheless appropriate for dealing with items missing from completed SF-36 questionnaires in most situations of routine use. These results can reasonably be extended to other questionnaires constructed according to classical test theory.},

Often there is no mention of generalizability in qualitative studies. When generalizability is mentioned in sport and exercise science journals it is often talked about briefly or highlighted as a limitation/ weakness of qualitative research. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed discussion of generalisation in order to dispel any misunderstandings or myths about generalizability in qualitative research and offer guidance about how researchers might consider generalisation. It is emphasised that it is a misunderstanding to claim that qualitative research lacks generalizability. It is highlighted that statistical types of generalizability that inform quantitative research are not applicable to judge the value of qualitative research or claim that it lacks generalizability. Reasons as to why researchers might consider generalizability in qualitative research are then offered. It is emphasised that generalisations can be made from qualitative research, but just not in the same way as quantitative results are. To help guide how generalisation might be considered, four different types of generalizability are presented: naturalistic generalisation, transferability, analytical generalizability and intersectional generalizability. Practical strategies are also offered for considering generalizability when seeking to publish qualitative research or reflect on already published work. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations to support high quality and rigorous qualitative research for scholars – including journal editors and reviewers – in relation to generalizability. Generalisation is a term ordinarily discussed in relation to quantitative research. Generalizability is also often used to define quantitative research in positive ways. It is said that when properly applied quantitative methods can produce reliable results from a representative sample of participants that can be applied to a wider population or different contexts. Given that, the results from good quantitative research can be viewed as useful and beneficial. For instance, health policy-makers can confidently apply results from quantitative studies to the general population so that hopefully numerous publics can benefit. Likewise, quantitative research is often deemed of use to sport organisation leaders, sport psychologists, physical activity groups and sport coaches as they are provided with a seemingly gen-eralizable and objective base on which to plan programmes and apply for funding. Generalisation is not however a term ordinarily discussed or explicitly engaged with in qualitative studies published in the sport and exercise sciences. That is not to say that there is a complete absence},

abstract = {Adequate reporting of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) is necessary to allow accurate critical appraisal of the validity and applicability of the results. The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement, a 22-item checklist and flow diagram, is intended to address this problem by improving the reporting of RCTs. However, some specific issues that apply to trials of nonpharmacologic treatments (for example, surgery, technical interventions, devices, rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and behavioral intervention) are not specifically addressed in the CONSORT Statement. Furthermore, considerable evidence suggests that the reporting of nonpharmacologic trials still needs improvement. Therefore, the CONSORT group developed an extension of the CONSORT Statement for trials assessing nonpharmacologic treatments. A consensus meeting of 33 experts was organized in Paris, France, in February 2006, to develop an extension of the CONSORT Statement for trials of nonpharmacologic treatments. The participants extended 11 items from the CONSORT Statement, added 1 item, and developed a modified flow diagram. To allow adequate understanding and implementation of the CONSORT extension, the CONSORT group developed this elaboration and explanation document from a review of the literature to provide examples of adequate reporting. This extension, in conjunction with the main CONSORT Statement and other CONSORT extensions, should help to improve the reporting of RCTs performed in this field.},

abstract = {Comments on an article by Colin P. West et al. (see record [rid]2012-28666-012[/rid]). West et al. demonstrate with multiple data sets that single items perform similarly to the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) long-form measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization in terms of associations with suicidality, serious thoughts of dropping out of medical school, endorsing dishonest behavior, disagreeing with an altruistic attitude, and perceived major medical error. The single items examined by West et al. were those found in previous analyses to have the largest factor loadings on emotional exhaustion. It would have been informative if West et al. had reported the performance of all the items in the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scales. In addition, they could have evaluated whether associations of individual items with the criterion variables vary by characteristics such as gender and age. The demonstration by West et al. of the similarity of a single item subset to the sum of items measuring a single concept is the underpinning of short-form measures. In summary, all items in unidimensional scales are positively associated with one another and the total scale score. For scales that represent narrow concepts, the items will tend to be more highly correlated, and the total score may be estimated accurately with fewer items. However, equivalence of scores produced from single versus multiple items needs to be demonstrated and tradeoffs carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.

Drawing from a recent review of the literature, we describe how both optimism and shifts from optimism serve the common goal of preparedness, which includes a readiness to deal with setbacks and a readiness to take advantage of opportunities. Shifts from optimism occur in response to available information and to the possibility that things may not turn out as hoped. People tend to shift from optimism when feedback is anticipated in the near future, when the outcome is important, when negative outcomes are easily imagined, and when the outcomes are uncontrollable. In addition, people with low self-esteem shift from optimism more readily than do people with high self-esteem. Finally, both optimism and shifts from optimism have unique benefits in terms of preparedness.},

@article{Diehl2014,
abstract = {Humans are able to reflect on and interpret their own aging. Thus, as individuals grow older, calendar age may become increasingly a subjective variable. This theoretical paper proposes the concept of Awareness of Aging (AoA) as a superordinate construct that can serve an integrative function in developmental research on subjective aging. It is argued that the AoA construct can incorporate the theoretical components of other existing concepts by acknowledging that judgments of subjective aging tend to be made on an awareness continuum ranging from pre-conscious/implicit to conscious/explicit. We also argue that processes of AoA are inherently self-related processes and that AoA is a particular aspect of self-awareness that results in specific aging-related self-knowledge. Over time, aging individuals incorporate this self-knowledge into their self-concept and personal identity. We provide theoretical evidence showing that although all major theories of adult development and aging draw on phenomena related to AoA, the explicit incorporation of aging-related awareness processes has been missing. We also provide an overarching framework to illustrate in a heuristic way how AoA in combination and interaction with other influences affects developmental outcomes. Finally, we argue that attention to AoA-related processes has a number of societal and applied implications and thereby addresses issues of applied developmental psychology. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The first part introduces a conceptualisation of acute cultural adaptation (ACA), which extends the current literature in sport psychology by offering original insights into mechanisms underpinning adaptive processes to a new cultural site during an interim relocation. Rereading a self-determination theory through the lens of cultural epistemology, the proposed theorisation suggests that ACA is realised in everyday practices drawing on a range of material and symbolic cultural resources to satisfy basic psychological needs. The second part of the paper engages the conceptualisation of ACA to make sense of the adaptive processes as experienced by female swimmers from Finland during their training camp in Australia. The study's findings highlight relatedness as a discursive cultural space, offering a starting point for examining the role of culture in psychological functions during short-term relocation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The need to largely reduce the amount of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions in the coming years all over the world requires a large effort in decarbonising the economy. One of the sectors most in need of this effort is the transportation sector. In fact, only a large reduction of CO2 emissions in this sector will allow coping effectively with this problem. There are two ways to perform it (1) by increasing the amount of biofuels to be used by Internal Combustion Motors or (2) by making a shift towards electromobility. However, this shift towards the electrification of the transportation sector can only be well succeeded if one increases simultaneously the proportion of non-CO2-emitting power generation technologies, namely renewable based power sources. European Union (EU) is developing a large effort on these matters. In fact, the energy-related targets set by EU policy require careful exami- nation of potential solutions for the integration of renewable energy sources to meet the electricity demand. On the other side, the expected growing energy demand resulting from the introduction of electric-powered cars needs the development of innovative concepts to exploit the variable power supply. The application of dynamic techniques for prediction of electricity supply and demand, including electricity prices in the market, is expected to support the optimisation of the grid balance. The European wind markets predict an installed capacity that would provide 14 {\%} of the electricity consumption in 2020. Today in Denmark and Portugal, the wind power accounts for more than 20 {\%} of the power production.},

Maddux has proposed that there are different types of self-efficacy and that these types may fulfill different roles in the motivation of behavior, perhaps based on characteristics of the target behavior. The purpose of this study was to examine 3 different types of self-efficacy: task, coping, and scheduling and their respective usefulness in distinguishing among persons reporting different levels of exercise involvement. A cross-sectional telephone survey using exercise behavior as the selection criterion was completed with 203 adults. Results showed that coping and scheduling efficacy were the best disciminators of level of exercise behavior. Task efficacy did not clearly distinguish between exercise groups. The theoretical and applied implications are discussed, particularly noting specific targets for future intervention.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Objectives: To test a performance-attainment model derived from the Dualistic Model of Passion [Vallerand et al. (2003). Les passions de l'{\^{a}}me: On obsessive and harmonious passion. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85, 756-767] that posits that both harmonious and obsessive passions are positive predictors of deliberate practice that, in turn, is a positive predictor of performance. Design: A prospective design was used in the present study. Methods and results: The basic model was tested in two studies using structural equation modeling. Results from Study 1 with 184 high school basketball players indicated that both harmonious and obsessive passions were positive predictors of deliberate practice, which, in turn, was a positive predictor of objective performance. The results of Study 2, conducted with 67 synchronized swimming and water-polo athletes conceptually replicated those from Study 1. Furthermore, results differentially linked the two passions to achievement goals and subjective well-being (SWB). Specifically, harmonious passion was a positive predictor of mastery goal pursuit and SWB, whereas obsessive passion was a positive predictor of mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goal pursuit and was unrelated to SWB. Mastery goals were positive predictors of deliberate practice, which was a direct positive predictor of performance, whereas performance-avoidance goals were direct negative predictors of performance. Conclusions: It appears that there are two paths to high-level performance attainment in sport, depending if harmonious or obsessive passion underlies sport engagement. While the path from harmonious passion is conducive to high levels of performance and living a happy life, that from obsessive passion is less reliably related to performance attainment and is unrelated to happiness. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant levels of optimism bias were found for several events (e.g., suffering/causing injury). Though optimism bias was not related to perceived controllability, administration of OHS by management may explain why this observation differs from findings in other domains. While further study is required, the present study demonstrates that people tend to think hazardous events at work are less likely to happen to themselves compared to others doing the same job, which has important implications for management of safety at work.},

abstract = {Youth involved in child welfare and juvenile justice systems suffer from alarmingly high rates of mental health challenges. In particular, exposure to trauma (e.g., maltreatment) is one critical experience that amplifies their risk for delinquency and recidivism. Despite a profound need to address these youth's mental health needs, there is a paucity of trauma-informed and youth-centered treatments that are clinically feasible in under-resourced residential settings (e.g., juvenile detention facilities). In response to this gap, our research team collaborated with the juvenile justice subsection of a large American city's child welfare system with the goal of creating an intervention tailored to the needs of underserved system-involved youth. The resultant program, WRITE ON (Writing and Reflecting on Identity To Empower Ourselves as Narrators), leverages research on the therapeutic benefits of expressive writing to implement a brief, cost-effective intervention in youth residential settings. This paper describes intervention development and presents findings from the pilot study, which comprised a multisite experimental evaluation of youth (N = 53) residing in short-term detention facilities. This pilot study aimed to: 1) assess intervention implementation fidelity, including participant satisfaction, and 2) evaluate the mental health outcomes of youth receiving WRITE ON as compared to those in a comparison support group (CSG). Results indicated that the intervention was delivered with good fidelity, participants reported high levels of satisfaction, and WRITE ON participants exhibited significant (p {\textless} 0.01) gains in resilience compared to their counterparts in the CSG. Collectively, results suggest that a larger clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of WRITE ON with system-involved youth is warranted.},

@phdthesis{Glendinning2018,
abstract = {Self-determination theory is a theory of personality and motivation that provides one perspective on the social-cognitive dimensions that underpin human behaviour. According to self-determination theory, there are three needs that are universally fundamental for self-determined motivation and psychological well-being. The hypothesis of universal needs suggests that, when satisfied, autonomy, competence and relatedness are equally beneficial for all people, regardless of individual differences in need strength (c.f., Deci {\&} Ryan, 1985; Ryan {\&} Deci, 2002). However, other theories developed within personality and social psychology tend to view needs as learned and varied (e.g., McClelland, 1985; Murray, 1938). As such, there is some debate as to whether the needs described by self-determination theory are universal requirements, or whether they are learned dispositions that vary for all people (Sheldon {\&} Niemiec, 2006). Sense of coherence (Antonovsky, 1979; 1987) is another perspective on psychological health and well-being whose core dimensions appear to share some similarities with self-determination theory. However, the theories have different traditional foci. Research in sense of coherence theory is traditionally concerned with how sense of coherence ultimately leads to survival in the sense that one has no functional limitation (e.g., low levels of depression). On the other hand, empirical research in self-determination theory has historically focused on how basic need satisfaction facilitates optimal psychological well-being and growth orientated behaviour. Because of the difference in traditional foci, research within the framework of sense of coherence and basic needs satisfaction has taken place independently. As such, the relationship between the two theories and associated well-being is yet to be addressed. Chapter 2 of this thesis provides evidence that the benefits of need satisfaction are in fact not always equal; rather they are dependent on their relative intra-individual importance. Studies 1 to 4 show that the motivation benefits associated with need satisfaction gained via a specific activity depend on intra-individual differences in need importance. Studies 3 and 4 show that for the general population, the effects of need satisfaction on general well-being were equal for all people regardless of the importance attached to each need. Those data support Deci and Ryan's (1985) universal benefits position. However, studies 1 and 4 show that when an individual's sense of identity is highly related to their investment in a specific activity, the association between need satisfaction (via an important activity) and general well-being depends on the intra-individual level of need importance. Those data counter the universal benefits position. Collectively these findings support the position that self-determination theories basic psychological needs are not always universally required for motivation and well-being. Chapter 3 of the present thesis (study 5) provides evidence that there is a considerable conceptual overlap amongst the dimensions of sense of coherence and basic needs perspectives. In addition, satisfaction of basic needs significantly mediated the relationship between sense of coherence and positive well-being (measured via life satisfaction, vitality and informant rated coping effectiveness health/performance), but failed to mediate the relationship between sense of coherence and the absence of psychiatric symptoms. In addition, analyses revealed that sense of coherence was directly associated lower levels of psychiatric symptoms. Collectively these findings are in line with the origin of both theories. That is, sense of coherence appears to have a direct relationship with lower levels of psychiatric illness, whereas basic need satisfaction does not. Instead, basic need satisfaction is associated with positive well-being.},

Discrepancies between earlier and later accounts can be attributed to differences in: (1) the relation of observer to participant, (2) theory brought to the field by the ethnographer, (3) internal processes within the field site itself, or (4) forces external to the field site. Focused revisits tend to settle on one or another of these four explanations, giving rise to four types of focused revisits. Using examples, the limits of each type of focused revisit are explored with a view to developing a reflexive ethnography that combines all four approaches. The principles of the fo- cused revisit are then extended to rolling, punctuated, heuristic, archeological, and valedictory revisits. In centering attention on ethnography-as-revisit sociologists directly confront the dilemmas of participating in the world they study-a world that undergoes (real) historical change that can only be grasped using a (constructed) theoretical lens.},

abstract = {Although interaction effects are frequently found in experimental studies, field researchers report considerable difficulty in finding theorized moderator effects. Previous discussions of this discrepancy have considered responsible factors including differences in measurement error and use of nonlinear scales. In this article we demonstrate that the differential efficiency of experimental and field tests of interactions is also attributable to the differential residual variances of such interactions once the component main effects have been partialed out. We derive an expression for this residual variance in terms of the joint distribution of the component variables and explore how properties of the distribution affect the efficiency of tests of moderator effects. We show that tests of interactions in field studies will often have less than 20{\%} of the efficiency of optimal experimental tests, and we discuss implications for the design of field studies.},

abstract = {Traditional talent development pathways for adolescents in team sports follow talent identification procedures based on subjective games ratings and isolated athletic assessment. Most talent development models are exclusive rather than inclusive in nature. Subsequently, talent identification may result in discontentment, premature stratification, or dropout from team sports. Understanding the multidimensional differences among the requirements of adolescent and elite adult athletes could provide more realistic goals for potential talented players. Coach education should include adolescent development, and rewards for team success at the adolescent level should reflect the needs of long-term player development. Effective talent development needs to incorporate physical and psychological maturity, the relative age effect, objective measures of game sense, and athletic prowess. The influences of media and culture on the individual, and the competing time demands between various competitions for player training time should be monitored and mediated where appropriate. Despite the complexity, talent development is a worthy investment in professional team sport. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

Contrastive Vignette Technique (CVT), an indirect-structured methodology designed to overcome many of the shortcomings inherent in current techniques, is presented. Three construct validation procedures were carried out in attempting to provide evidence for the value of the CVT approach in the assessment of group attitudes: Prediction of convergent and divergent response patterns based on group membership, comparison against concurrent direct measurement of the same conceptual content area, and comparison of'response patterns across and within vignettes. Overall results provided support for the validity of the present approach. Of 16 directional response-pattern predictions made in the first experiment, 15 were confirmed, and the remaining prediction was in the expected direction. In the second procedure, expectations of differential response patterns were more clearly observed in CVT performance than in responses on direct scales designed to address the same content. Results of the final experiment suggested that CVT performance was consistent and transsituational, but that the effect of the evaluative context was stronger than expected. Extension and application of CVT is discussed.},

abstract = {In depression research, symptoms are routinely assessed via rating scales and added to construct sum-scores. These scores are used as a proxy for depression severity in cross-sectional research, and differences in sum-scores over time are taken to reflect changes in an underlying depression construct. To allow for such interpretations, rating scales must (a) measure a single construct, and (b) measure that construct in the same way across time. These requirements are referred to as unidimensionality and measurement invariance. We investigated these 2 requirements in 2 large prospective studies (combined n = 3,509) in which overall depression levels decrease, examining 4 common depression rating scales (1 self-report, 3 clinician-report) with different time intervals between assessments (between 6 weeks and 2 years). A consistent pattern of results emerged. For all instruments, neither unidimensionality nor measurement invariance appeared remotely tenable. At least 3 factors were required to describe each scale, and the factor structure changed over time. Typically, the structure became less multifactorial as depression severity decreased (without however reaching unidimensionality). The decrease in the sum-scores was accompanied by an increase in the variances of the sum-scores, and increases in internal consistency. These findings challenge the common interpretation of sum-scores and their changes as reflecting 1 underlying construct. The violations of common measurement requirements are sufficiently severe to suggest alternative interpretations of depression sum-scores as formative instead of reflective measures. We discuss the possible causes of these violations such as response shift bias, restriction of range, and regression to the mean.},

The model was tested using partial least squares latent variable modelling.

Behavioural regulations were predicted by participation motives: intrinsic regulation by affiliation and chal-lenge motives; identified regulation by health/fitness and stress management motives; introjected regulation by appearance/weight motive; external regula-tion by social recognition and appearance/weight motives; all positively. Participation motives were themselves predicted by corresponding life goals. The findings support the three-level model of motivation.

abstract = {This paper presents a checklist to assess the character of likely avalanche activity for the purpose of backcountry travel decisions. The purpose of the checklist is to help bridge the gap between stability assessment and risk management decisions about travel on specific terrain features. The checklist expresses the character, and to some extent the spatial variability, of snowpack instability rather than the likelihood of avalanche occurrence. There is inherently less uncertainty about the type of avalanches likely to occur than about the probability of triggering avalanches on specific terrain features. However, assessing the character of possible avalanches is even more relevant than assessing the ease of triggering avalanches when managing the risk of travel in backcountry terrain. The checklist is proposed as a method for professional guides and experienced recreationists to help communicate their subjective thought processes and to provide structure for assessing the character of potential avalanche activity. Avalanche activity is separated into different regimes, and potential for avalanches in each regime is then assessed. Examples of “avalanche regimes” include “Wind Slabs Near Ridge tops”, “Glide Avalanches”, etc. The motivation for this checklist comes from my observations during decades of work as a helicopter ski guide in western North America. This is a practitioner's viewpoint inspired by the increasing wisdom of backcountry travelers and improved means of communication. The intent of the checklist is to better express our snowpack instability concerns in a systematic way that is meaningful for backcountry risk management.},

Most previous studies of the human dimensions of decision making in avalanche ter- rain has focused on post-accident analysis using accident reports/interviews and the development of tools as decision forcing aids. We present an alternative method for understanding decision-making in ava- lanche terrain. Our project combines real-time GPS tracking via a smartphone application, with internet based surveys of backcountry skiers as a method to describe and quantify travel practices in concert with group decision-making dynamics, and demographic data of participants during daily excursions into win- ter backcountry. We present a subset of the results of more than 2000 unique trips by more than 500 in- dividuals and groups. Preliminary data analyses shows that individual experience level, group size and gender all influence the terrain used when standardized for regional avalanche danger rating. Furthermore, when only the region- al danger rating is considered limited differences are seen in the slope angles used. Using these data we also examine the role of heuristic traps to assess their impact on terrain use. Our results provide the first analysis of coupled real-time GPS tracking of people moving in avalanche terrain combined with psycho- graphic and demographic correlates.

Methods and Results-Using the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure Registry, we linked clinical data from 16 052 heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction ≤40{\%}) patients with Medicare claims data. We divided ACEi/ARB-eligible patients into 4 categories based on admission and discharge ACEi/ARB use: continued (reference group), started, discontinued, or not started on therapy. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the association between ACEi/ARB category and outcomes. Most, 90.5{\%}, were discharged on ACEi/ARB (59.6{\%} continued and 30.9{\%} newly started). Of those discharged without ACEi/ARB, 1.9{\%} were discontinued, and 7.5{\%} were eligible but not started. Thirty-day mortality was 3.5{\%} for patients continued and 4.1{\%} for patients started on ACEi/ARB. In contrast, 30-day mortality was 8.8{\%} for patients discontinued (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj] 1.92; 95{\%} CI 1.32-2.81; P {\textless} 0.001) and 7.5{\%} for patients not started (HRadj 1.50; 95{\%} CI 1.12-2.00; P=0.006).

The results indicated that the model with Bayesian estimation and weakly informative priors provided a good fit to the data, whereas the model estimated with a maximum likelihood estimator did not produce a well-fitting model. The reasons for this discrepancy between maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation are discussed as well as potential advantages and caveats with the Bayesian approach.},

abstract = {Differences between avalanche experts and novices have long been cited as a key issue in designing effective avalanche education, yet few investigations have quantitatively explored these differ-ences. In this study, we examine how self-reported training, knowledge, skills, and behavior differ be-tween avalanche experts and novices. From 2002 to 2004, we surveyed 300 avalanche professionals and winter recreationists regarding their demographics, risk taking, experience, training, involvement in ava-lanches, knowledge of someone killed, seeking feedback about stable and unstable conditions, reviewing of prior frequency of carrying rescue gear, use of avalanche bulletins, and ranking of signs of instability and stability. We received 161 responses, and found numerous differences between avalanche profes-sionals and recreationists across varying levels of expertise. Surprising was the similarity in both groups' ranking of signs of instability and stability, suggesting that recreationists and professionals had similar basic knowledge regarding avalanche hazard. Correlation analysis of rankings and rank variances sug-gests that much of the professional respondents' learning took place through personal experience in ava-lanche terrain, whereas almost all of the learning by recreationists was the result of training. Recreation-ists' apparent lack of success in learning through direct experience suggests a gap between their techni-cal knowledge about avalanches and their ability to apply what they know. These results have important implications for recreational avalanche programs that intend to equip their students for making effective decisions in the backcountry.},

Relationship researchers most commonly use difference scores to index the (dis)similarity of members of two-person relationships. Using an intuitive, graphical approach - and avoiding formulas and pointing fingers - we illustrate problems with using difference score correlations in relationship research, suggest ways to ensure that difference score correlations are maximally informative, and briefly review alternatives to difference score correlations in studying similarity, accuracy, and related constructs.

abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients. {\textcopyright} 1992, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

Our research integrated SDT, which defines psychological needs (including competence) as universally essential experiences, and motive disposition theories, which define psychological needs as individually varying non-conscious motives. A cross-sectional and a longitudinal study showed that felt competence in a sports activity has especially positive effects on subsequent flow and intrinsic motivation for individuals high in the need for achievement. Study 3 showed that felt competence more strongly influences subsequent academic goal motivation for those high in the need for achievement.

abstract = {Despite the high prevalence of stress exposure healthy adaptation or resilience is a common response. Theoretical work and recent empirical evidence suggest that a robust reward system, in part, supports healthy adaptation by preserving positive emotions even under exceptionally stressful circumstances. We tested this prediction by examining empirical relations among behavioral and self-reported measures of sensitivity to reward, trait resilience, and measures of affect in the context of experimentally induced stress. Using a quasi-experimental design we obtained measures of sensitivity to reward (self-report and behavioral), as well as affective and physiological responses to experimental psychosocial stress in a sample of 140 healthy college-age participants. We used regression-based moderation and mediational models to assess associations among sensitivity to reward, affect in the context of stress, and trait resilience and found that an interaction between exposure to experimental stress and self-reported sensitivity to reward predicted positive affect following experimental procedure. Participants with high sensitivity to reward reported higher positive affect following stress. Moreover, positive affect during or after stress mediated the relation between sensitivity to reward and trait resilience. Consistent with the prediction that a robust reward system serves as a protective factor against stress-related negative outcomes, our results found predictive associations among sensitivity to reward, positive affect, and resilience.},

In this article, the foundations of Bayesian analysis are introduced, and we will illustrate how to apply Bayesian structural equation modeling in a sport and exercise psychology setting. More specifically, we contrasted a confirmatory factor analysis on the Sport Motivation Scale II estimated with the most commonly used estimator, maximum likelihood, and a Bayesian approach with weakly informative priors for cross-loadings and correlated residuals. The results indicated that the model with Bayesian estimation and weakly informative priors provided a good fit to the data, whereas the model estimated with a maximum likelihood estimator did not produce a well-fitting model. The reasons for this discrepancy between maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation are discussed as well as potential advantages and caveats with the Bayesian approach.},

Approximately 90{\%} of participants experienced one or more potentially traumatic events. Events that occurred with greater frequency early in the life course were associated with more severe PTSD symptoms compared to events that occurred with greater frequency during later decades. Early life traumas, however, were not more central to identity. Results underscore the differential impact of traumatic events experienced throughout the life course. We conclude with suggestions for further research concerning mechanisms that promote the persistence of post-traumatic stress related to early life traumas and empirical evaluation of psychotherapeutic treatments for older adults with PTSD.},

They examined various aspects of reliability and validity of scale scores, and concluded that the new scale performs better than the original version. They also claimed that the SMS-II is superior to other measures of motivation in sport, including the Behavioral Regulation in Sport Questionnaire (BRSQ) developed by Lonsdale, Hodge, and Rose (2008). By comparing the evidence presented in papers by Pelletier etal. and Lonsdale etal., our objective was to examine the relative merits and shortcomings of the two measures and suggest directions for future research into sport motivation measurement. Conclusions: Both the SMS-II and BRSQ have shown relative strengths and weaknesses. Overall, the construct validity evidence of scores derived from the two measures was similar. There is insufficient information to support the claim that one scale is superior to the other. Researchers are encouraged to make direct comparisons by administering both measures to the same group of participants in future studies. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {Paddlesports as outdoor recreation (OR) have become popular options for leisure time consumption and as a means to obtain well-being. The concept of serious leisure (SL) was used to measure and explain the associations between committed leisure experiences and multiple outcomes in a sample (n = 171) of paddlesport enthusiasts. CFA fit indices revealed that all models demonstrated acceptable fit, which justified the creations of composite-level indicators. A path analysis was then conducted to assess the relationship between the six factors of a SL experience and multiple outcomes: personal, social and financial. Path analysis revealed that SL experiences partially explained the variances of personal outcomes (46{\%}), social outcomes (53{\%}) and financial return (21{\%}). The path model showed that personal and social outcomes were positively associated with most SL factors but financial return was not significantly predicted by any SL factor. SL factor career contingency was negatively associated with personal outcomes at the p {\textless} .01 level, a potential indication of the costs of their commitment to paddling. The results of this study indicated factors enhanced or hindered personal and social developments gained from SL participation. This suggests that outdoor recreation practitioners may develop customized strategies to sustain clients' healthy engagements in the pursuit. This study uses the notion of serious leisure to explain how people commit to paddling sports and how various dimensions of leisure commitment are related to personal and social benefits. In serious leisure, participants usually need to establish competencies and perseverance in order to enjoy and sustain an outdoor recreation experience. Along with their ongoing pursuits, recreationists also develop and strengthen their personal and social identities toward this activity and thus their pursuits fulfill them personally and socially. The results of this study, in general, supported that serious leisure experiences are associated with personal and social benefits. Nonetheless, potential issues, such as a coerced or competitive social environment, can prevent some participants from receiving benefits. The findings of this study provide practical implications for outdoor recreation practitioners and participants to design sustainable and committed experiences.},

Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Cognitive evaluation theory, which explains the effects of extrinsic motivators on intrinsic motivation, received some initial attention in the organizational literature. However, the simple dichotomy between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation made the theory difficult to apply to work settings. Differentiating extrinsic motivation into types that differ in their degree of autonomy led to self-determination theory, which has received widespread attention in the education, health care, and sport domains. This article describes self-determination theory as a theory of work motivation and shows its relevance to theories of organizational behavior.

@article{Wirtz2007,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that perfectionism is an important moderator of the neuroendocrine stress response, with higher perfectionism predicting increased neuroendocrine activation. METHODS: A total of 50 middle-aged men underwent an acute standardized psychosocial stress task (Trier Social Stress Test). Perfectionism, cognitive appraisal of the stressful situation, trait anxiety, and various personality characteristics were assessed with questionnaires. Salivary cortisol, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine, blood pressure, and heart rate were analyzed before and after stress. Circadian profiles of cortisol secretion during the day and in response to awakening were analyzed to assess basal activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of the neuroendocrine stress response. RESULTS: Perfectionism was significantly associated with area under the total response curve with respect to increase (AUCi) of cortisol (r = 0.322, p = .046), but not with AUCi of norepinephrine (r = -0.217, p = .152) or AUCi of epinephrine (r = 0.116, p = .477). Hence, AUCi of cortisol was the main criterion. As possible predictors, trait anxiety, neuroticism, vital exhaustion, secondary appraisal, depression, and openness were considered. Regression analyses demonstrated that only perfectionism (beta = 0.45, p = .002) and secondary appraisal (beta = 0.50, p = .001) were independent predictors of AUCi of cortisol, the final model explaining 45{\%} of the total variance in cortisol response (R2 = 0.45, "shrunken" R2 [sR2] = 0.38); perfectionism alone accounted for 18{\%} of this variance (deltaR2 = 0.18, sR2 = 0.19). CONCLUSION: The typical cognitions, and presumably the associated emotions, of perfectionists seem to contribute independently to stress-induced bodily responses, including HPA axis activation, in response to psychosocial stress.},

abstract = {This paper presents a reconciliation of the three distinct ways in which the research literature has defined overconfidence: (1) overestimation of one's actual performance, (2) overplacement of one's performance relative to others, and (3) excessive precision in one's beliefs.  Experimental evidence shows that reversals of the first two (apparent underconfidence), when they occur, tend to be on different types of tasks.  On difficult tasks, people overestimate their actual performances but also believe that they are worse than others; on easy tasks, people underestimate their actual performances but believe they are better than others.  This paper offers a straightforward theory that can explain these inconsistencies.  Overprecision appears to be more persistent than either of the other two types of overconfidence, but its presence reduces the magnitude of both overestimation and overplacement.},

The introduction is geared toward reviewers, editors, and inter-ested researchers who are new to Bayesian statistics. We provide commentary for eight recommended sources, which together cover the theoretical and practical cornerstones of Bayesian statistics in psychology and related sciences. The resources are presented in an incremental order, start-ing with theoretical foundations and moving on to applied issues. In addition, we outline an additional 32 articles and books that can be consulted to gain background knowledge about various theoretical specifics and Bayesian approaches to frequently used models. Our goal is to offer researchers a starting point for understanding the core tenets of Bayesian analysis, while requiring a low level of time commitment. After consulting our guide, the reader should understand how and why Bayesian methods work, and feel able to evaluate their use in the behavioral and social sciences.},

The present study explored self-discrepancies in self-confidence in relation to performance and cognitive anxiety. Slalom canoeists (n = 81) reported ideal, ought, and feared levels of self-confidence 3 hours before a national ranking slalom tournament. Within a half-hour of the start of the race, canoeists reported their actual self-confidence and cognitive anxiety levels. Hierarchical multiple-regression analyses revealed that self-discrepancies predicted significantly more performance variance than actual self-confidence alone. Additionally, hierarchical multiple-regression analyses revealed that, contrary to the specific predictions of self-discrepancy theory, ideal and feared discrepancies (not “ought” and “feared” discrepancies) significantly predicted cognitive anxiety. Additional findings, implications, and directions for further research into the nature of the self in sport are discussed.},

The past years have resulted in over 40 scientific publications and numerous conference symposia and workshops. Now is an excellent moment to take stock of the network approach: What are its most fundamental challenges, and what are potential ways forward in addressing them? After a brief conceptual introduction, we first discuss challenges to network theory: (1) What is the validity of the network approach beyond some commonly investigated disorders such as major depression? (2) How do we best define psychopathological networks and their constituent elements? And (3) how can we gain a better understanding of the causal nature and real-life underpinnings of associations among symptoms? Next, after a short technical introduction to network modeling, we discuss challenges to network methodology: (4) heterogeneity of samples studied with network analytic models, and (5) a lurking replicability crisis in this strongly data-driven and exploratory field. Addressing these challenges may propel the network approach from its adolescence into adulthood and promises advances in understanding psychopathology both at the nomothetic and idiographic level.},

These methods grew out of a historic debate regarding the indeterminate nature of the common factor model. Unfortunately, most researchers are unaware of the indeterminacy issue and the problems associated with a number of the factor scoring procedures. This article reviews the history and nature of factor score indeterminacy. Novel computer programs for assessing the degree of indeterminacy in a given analysis, as well as for computing and evaluating different types of factor scores, are then presented and demonstrated using data from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition. It is argued that factor score indeterminacy should be routinely assessed and reported as part of any exploratory factor analysis and that factor scores should be thoroughly evaluated before they are reported or used in subsequent statistical analyses.},

abstract = {This chapter describes a developmental network, a group of individuals who take an active interest in and action to advance a focal individual's personal and professional growth, as a vehicle that bridges formal and informal mentoring relationships. While developmental networks have received strong attention in the organizational research on private sector work environments, they have received little attention in other equally relevant contexts, including education and health care. As such, the chapter explains how developmental networks can act as holding environments for growth in a variety of contexts where individuals face regular challenges as they strive for effectiveness and well-being. Developers—those who take an active interest in the focal individual and are identified by the focal individual—provide much needed support and guidance through holding behaviors like confirmation, contradiction, and continuity. After illustrating what developmental networks look like in different contexts, we identify and discuss how several institutional and organizational factors pose opportunities and/or obstacles for developmental networks over time. These organizational conditions may be especially relevant in certain contexts and so raise particular issues for extending the notion of developmental networks beyond traditionally studied work settings.},

abstract = {Although high-risk sport participants are typically considered a homogenous risk-taking population, attitudes to risk within the high-risk domain can vary considerably. As no validated measure allows researchers to assess risk taking within this domain, we validated the Risk Taking Inventory (RTI) for high-risk sport across four studies. The RTI comprises seven items across two factors: deliberate risk taking and precautionary behaviors. In Study 1 (n = 341), the inventory was refined and tested via a confirmatory factor analysis used in an exploratory fashion. The subsequent three studies confirmed the RTI's good model-data fit via three further separate confirmatory factor analyses. In Study 2 (n = 518) and in Study 3 (n = 290), concurrent validity was also confirmed via associations with other related traits (sensation seeking, behavioral activation, behavioral inhibition, impulsivity, self-esteem, extraversion, and conscientiousness). In Study 4 (n = 365), predictive validity was confirmed via associations with mean accidents and mean close calls in the high-risk domain. Finally, in Study 4, the self-report version of the inventory was significantly associated with an informant version of the inventory. The measure will allow researchers and practitioners to investigate risk taking as a variable that is conceptually distinct from participation in a high-risk sport.},

In either approach, it is possible to include auxiliary variables solely for the purpose of improving the missing data procedure. A simulation was presented to assess the potential costs and benefits of a restrictive strategy, which makes minimal use of auxiliary variables, versus an inclusive strategy, which makes liberal use of such variables. The simulation showed that the inclusive strategy is to be greatly preferred. With an inclusive strategy not only is there a reduced chance of inadvertently omitting an important cause of missingness, there is also the possibility of noticeable gains in terms of increased efficiency and reduced bias, with only minor costs. As implemented in currently available software, the ML approach tends to encourage the use of a restrictive strategy, whereas the MI approach makes it relatively simple to use an inclusive strategy.},

The participants, 260 college students, were given self-report measures of risky behaviors in each of the six areas and the Zuckerman-Kuhlman five-factor personality questionnaire. Generalized risk-taking (across all six areas) was related to scales for impulsive sensation seeking, aggression, and sociability, but not to scales for neuroticism or activity. Gender differences on risk-taking were mediated by differences on impulsive sensation seeking. The second part discusses biological traits associated with both risk-taking and personality, particularly sensation seeking, such as the D4 dopamine receptor gene. the enzyme monoamine oxidase, and augmenting or reducing of the cortical evoked potential. Comparative studies show relationships between biological markers shared with other species and correlated behaviors similar to sensation seeking in humans. A biosocial model of the traits underlying risk-taking is presented.},

abstract = {We investigated the change in mountaineers' affect from pre- to post-mountain route and the moderating role of self-regulation strategies in this process. First, we hypothesized that engagement in a high-risk sport such as mountaineering would lead to a decrease in negative affect and an increase in positive affect and that this affect regulation would be moderated by self-regulation strategies (escape from self-awareness and compensation). Second, we predicted that the self-regulation affect process would be specifically associated with high-risk sport rather than sport generally. One hundred and five mountaineers and 73 judokas completed the Risk and Excitement Inventory and the Positive and Negative Emotions Scale before and after completing their activity (mountain route or judo fight). Regression analyses revealed that anxiety significantly decreased from pre- to post-mountain route and that the self-regulation of escape from awareness yielded a significantly greater anxiety decrease. No such interaction emerged for the compensation strategy and no effects were revealed for judokas. Results are discussed in terms of the specificity of the high-risk sport domain in its ability to serve an affect regulation function for those individuals who seek to escape from self-awareness.},

abstract = {-The relation between perfectionism. anxiety, and self-consciousness was studied in a normal sample. The perfectionism dimensions of Concern over Mistakes, Doubts about Action, and Socially Prescribed Perfectionism showed a pattern of correlations not only with measures of social anxiety, but also with measures of agoraphobic fears, and fears of bodily injury, death and illness. Public self-con-sciousness also correlated with various measures of anxiety, but these correlations disappeared when the relevant dimensions of perfectionism were controlled for. It is concluded that perfectionism is a more relevant construct in the study of anxiety than is public self-consciousness.

abstract = {A sample of 222 university athletes (mean age 19.8 years, s = 2.0), ranging in standard from university second team to international competitor, completed a measure of perceived support 2 weeks before an important competition or match. On the day before the competition or match, the athletes completed measures of stressors, stress, received support, and self-confidence. Moderated hierarchical regression analyses revealed the following key findings: (i) main effects for both perceived (DeltaR2 = 0.11) and received support (DeltaR2 = 0.14) upon self-confidence; (ii) stress-buffering effects for both perceived (DeltaR2 = 0.02) and received (DeltaR2 = 0.07) support upon self-confidence; (iii) when both aspects of support were considered simultaneously, stress-buffering effects were primarily attributable to the influence of received support. These results demonstrate the beneficial impact of social support on self-confidence, both directly and by reducing the negative effect of stress on self-confidence. Our findings emphasize the need to recognize the distinction between perceived and received support, both in terms of theory and the design of social support interventions with athletes.},

Multiple methods were used to examine the effects of conflict on both individual- and group-level variables to provide a more refined model of intragroup conflict. Results show that whether conflict was beneficial depended on the type of conflict and the structure of the group in terms of task type, task interdependence, and group norms. Relationship and task conflicts were negatively associated with individuals' satisfaction, liking of other group members, and intent to remain in the group. In groups performing very routine tasks, disagreements about the task were detrimental to group functioning. In contrast, in groups performing nonroutine tasks, disagreements about the tasks did not have a detrimental effect, and in some cases, such disagreements were actually beneficial. Contrary to expectations, norms encouraging open discussion of conflict were not always advantageous. The results suggest that while such norms were associated with an increase in the number and intensity of relationship conflicts, they did not increase members' ability to deal with the conflicts constructively. The model developed here contributes to an integrated perspective on organizational conflict.},

A common belief, both in psychology and in popular culture, is that narcissism represents a form of excessive self-esteem. Psychologists, including ourselves, have labeled narcissism as “an exaggerated form of high self-esteem,” “inflated self-esteem,” and “defensive high self-esteem.” We review research that challenges this belief by showing that narcissism differs markedly from self-esteem in its phenotype, its consequences, its development, and its origins. Drawing on emerging developmental-psychological evidence, we propose a distinction between narcissism and self- esteem that is based on the divergent socialization experiences that give rise to them. This proposal clarifies previous findings, stimulates theory development, and creates opportunities for intervention to concurrently raise self-esteem and curtail narcissism from an early age.},

abstract = {Objectives: Appropriate tools to measure psychological skills in wheelchair athletes seldom exist within the sport psychology literature. Given the benefits of imagery on performance, and the lack of an appropriate wheelchair specific measure, the aim of this multi-study research programme was to develop a new psychometric tool to measure the vividness of movement imagery in wheelchair athletes. We used the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire–2 (VMIQ-2; Roberts, Callow, Hardy, Markland {\&} Bringer, 2008) as a conceptual framework for item creation and subsequent development of a new tool known as the Wheelchair Imagery Ability Questionnaire (WIAQ). Method: Study 1 focused on item creation for the WIAQ for the scale with a purposeful sample of wheelchair athletes using focus groups. Study 2 tested the factor structure of the WIAQ using a Bayesian Structural Equation Modelling (BSEM) approach. Study 3 provided concurrent validity of the WIAQ. Results: Study 1 resulted in the development of the initial 24 item WIAQ. Study 2 refined the scale through the use of BSEM to a 15 item measure. Study 3 provided support for the WIAQ evidence for the concurrent validity of the measure. Conclusion: The WIAQ is the first known measure specifically created to measure imagery ability in wheelchair athletes and has scope to be used in a broader rehabilitation context for individuals and practitioners making use of imagery as a tool to support various physical recovery strategies.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to replicate the distinction between errors, lapses and violations, and to identify aggressive violations from normal or highway code violations. Furthermore, the relationship of these behaviours with road traffic accidents was examined. A total number of 1126 Finnish drivers completed a questionnaire containing the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) with extended violations scale, and questions regarding background information, such as age, gender and mileage. Also, questions about previous accidents and fines were asked. Factor analysis showed that a four-factor structure seemed more appropriate than the earlier established three-factor structure. The four factors were errors, lapses, speeding violations and interpersonal violations. The two types of violations result from different motives, and seem to be associated with different kinds of affect. Both interpersonal and speeding violations were reported most by young males, which was consistent with earlier findings. Logistic regression analyses indicated that errors predicted active accident involvement after partialling out the effects of demographic variables, whereas interpersonal violations were positively related to involvement in passive accidents. This was presumably due to different reporting tendencies of respondents. Speeding tickets were predicted by speeding and interpersonal violations and lapses and penalties for speeding by both kinds of violations and errors. Penalties for speeding, parking and other offences were predicted by interpersonal violations. The implications of these results are discussed.},

The motivational construct identification with academics, which includes perceptions of belonging and valuing within an academic context, was investigated along with intrinsic/ extrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy as a predictors of cognitive engagement with 191 college students. Consistent with theoretical predictions, intercorrelations among measures of identification with academics, self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation were all positive, as were the correlations of those three variables with meaningful cognitive engagement. Those three variables were also negatively correlated with a measure of amotivation and not related to a measure of extrinsic motivation. Path analysis demonstrated that self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, and academic identification each contributed uniquely to the prediction of meaningful cognitive engagement.

@article{Victor2016,
abstract = {The field of affective clinical science has expanded dramatically over the past several decades (Rottenberg and Gross 2003; Tracy et al. 2014). An important part of this research is understanding emotion regulation and dysregula-tion, in particular, how individuals differ in their ability to identify, accept, and manage their emotional experiences. One of the most common and widely cited measures of emo-tion dysregulation is the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz and Roemer 2004), which has been ex-tensively used to facilitate understanding of how emotion dys-regulation is associated with psychiatric symptoms, other emotion-related constructs, and treatment progress. While this scale has contributed greatly to our understanding of emotion regulation problems, its length makes its inclusion in brief study protocols difficult, limiting its utility and increasing par-ticipant burden. In order to address this issue, we developed a short form version of the DERS (DERS-18) composed of the strongest items from each of the measure's six subscales from the original DERS publication (Gratz and Roemer 2004), and then validated this measure in five datasets that vary in age and sample type. Our results demonstrate that an 18-item short-form of the DERS exhibits a similar structure as the original 36-item DERS, demonstrates excellent reliability and validity, and performs similarly to the original DERS despite comprising half the items. The DERS-18 has the po-tential to improve and expand emotion regulation assessment while reducing demands on research participants. Extensive research has demonstrated the importance of under-standing how emotions influence psychopathology (Gross and Jazaieri 2014). In particular, understanding how people regulate their emotions has become a major area of focus for affective scientists (Tracy et al. 2014), with researchers using emotion regulation and dysregulation to explain important clinical phe-nomena such as depression (Joormann and Vanderlind 2014), anxiety (Mennin et al. 2009), and Borderline Personality Disorder (Glenn and Klonsky 2009). Emotion regulation has been broadly defined as Bthe pro-cesses by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express these emotions{\^{}} (Rottenberg and Gross 2003, p. 229). Gratz and Roemer (2004) expanded on this idea by considering the components necessary for successful emotion regulation, including awareness and acceptance of one's emo-tions, the ability to change emotions in accordance with one's goals, and the ability to control behavior in the face of nega-tive emotions, with emotion dysregulation being the absence of any of these abilities (p. 42–43). This multidimensional definition has been used by researchers in clinical psychology (Donahue et al. 2014; Racine and Wildes 2013) to understand how individuals differ not only in overall emotion regulation capacity, but also in specific emotion regulation deficits. The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz and Roemer 2004) was developed to facilitate thorough assess-ment of emotion dysregulation in a variety of populations. The DERS is a 36-item self-report questionnaire measuring emo-tion dysregulation that includes six factor-analytically-derived subscales: lack of awareness of one's emotions (awareness), lack of clarity about the nature of one's emotions (clarity), lack of acceptance of one's emotions (nonacceptance), lack of ac-cess to effective emotion regulation strategies (strategies), lack},

abstract = {Optimism is an individual difference variable that reflects the extent to which people hold generalized favorable expectancies for their future. Higher levels of optimism have been related prospectively to better subjective well-being in times of adversity or difficulty (i.e., controlling for previous well-being). Consistent with such findings, optimism has been linked to higher levels of engagement coping and lower levels of avoidance, or disengagement, coping. There is evidence that optimism is associated with taking proactive steps to protect one's health, whereas pessimism is associated with health-damaging behaviors. Consistent with such findings, optimism is also related to indicators of better physical health. The energetic, task-focused approach that optimists take to goals also relates to benefits in the socioeconomic world. Some evidence suggests that optimism relates to more persistence in educational efforts and to higher later income. Optimists also appear to fare better than pessimists in relationships. Although there are instances in which optimism fails to convey an advantage, and instances in which it may convey a disadvantage, those instances are relatively rare. In sum, the behavioral patterns of optimists appear to provide models of living for others to learn from. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Evidence for the role of affective states in social judgments is reviewed, and a new integrative theory, the affect infusion model (AIM), is proposed as a comprehensive explanation of these effects. The AIM, based on a multiprocess approach to social judgments, identifies 4 alternative judgmental strategies: (a) direct access, (b) motivated, (c) heuristic, and (d) substantive processing. The model predicts that the degree of affect infusion into judgments varies along a processing continuum, such that judgments requiring heuristic or substantive processing are more likely to be infused by affect than are direct access or motivated judgments. The role of target, judge, and situational variables in recruiting high- or low-infusion judgmental strategies is considered, and empirical support for the model is reviewed. The relationship between the AIM and other affect-cognition theories is discussed, and implications for future research are outlined. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

The randomized controlled trial (RCT) has limitations in its practicality, ethical appropriateness, and cost when evaluating population-based interventions. Like RCTs, the multiple baseline design can demonstrate that a change in behavior has occurred, the change is a result of the intervention, and the change is significant. Especially important practical advantages over the RCT are that this design requires fewer population groups and communities may act as their own controls. Advantages and methodologic limitations of the multiple baseline design are discussed, and where feasible, strategies to minimize the impact of its limitations are suggested.

abstract = {ISSN: 0269-9931 (Print) 1464-0600 (Online) Journal homepage: http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/pcem20 ABSTRACT This Special Issue of Cognition and Emotion addresses one of the cardinal concerns of affective science, which is overlapping and distinctive features of anxiety and depression. A central finding in the study of anxiety and depression is that they are moderately highly correlated with each other. This leads us to the question: What is behind this co-occurrence? Possible explanations relate to poor discriminant validity of measures; both emotional states are associated with negative affect; stressful life events; impaired cognitive processes; they share a common biological/genetic diathesis. However, despite a set of common (nonspecific) features, anxiety and depression are clearly not identical emotional states. Differences between them might be best viewed, for example, through their heterogeneous and multi-layered nature, adaptive functions and relations with regulatory processes, positive affect, and motivation or complex cognitive processes. In this introduction we consider several approaches (e.g. functional approach; tripartite model and content-specificity hypothesis) to which most research in this Special Issue is relevant. In addition, we have asked contributors to this Special Issue to indicate how their own studies on comparisons between anxiety and depression and models on anxiety and depression move this area of research to more mature science with applicability.

abstract = {Headline findings  Around nine in ten members of the English adult population visited the outdoors at least once in the last twelve months, while around two-fifths had taken a visit within the last seven days.  It is estimated that between March 2013 and February 2014, the 42.3 million adults resident in England took a total of 2.93 billion visits to the natural environment1. The majority were taken to destinations within towns/cities (1.36 billion) or countryside locations (1.31 billion).  Around a quarter of visits involved some form of expenditure – resulting in an estimated spend of {\pounds}17 billion between March 2013 and February 2014.  Parks in towns and cities were the most frequently visited destination type, accounting for 778 million visits.  Walking was by far the most frequently undertaken activity. Half of visits (an estimated 1.5 billion visits) involved walking with a dog while around a quarter (an estimated 775 million visits) involved walking without a dog.  Three-quarters of visits were less than two hours in duration, while two-thirds involved walking to the visit destination. Almost four-fifths were taken within two miles of the visit start point.  Visiting the natural environment for health or exercise accounted for an estimated 1.3 billion visits to the natural environment between March 2013 and February 2014. Factors relating to a lack of time were most likely to be cited as reasons for not visiting more often or at all. At face value, evidence of correlations between life satisfaction, self-worth, happiness and lower levels of anxiety with the regularity with which a person visits the natural environment seem to be apparent. However, as the relationship is merely associative, whether frequency of visiting natural environments influences well-being or having higher well-being causes more natural environment visits, is unclear.},

In 4 related studies, 1,225 athletes from Belgium and the United Kingdom were sampled. The first study provided content validity for an initial item set. The second study explored the factor structure of the CREST, yielding initial evidence but no conclusive results. In contrast, the third and fourth study provided evidence for a 2-factor measure, reflecting (a) the team's ability to display resilient characteristics and (b) the vulnerabilities being displayed under pressure. Overall, the CREST was shown to be reliable at the between-players and the between-teams level, as well as over time. Moreover, its concurrent validity was verified by linking the characteristics of team resilience with various relevant team processes. Its discriminant validity was established by comparing the CREST measures with individual athletes' resilient traits. In conclusion, the CREST was argued to be a usable state-like measure of team-level resilient characteristics and vulnerabilities. To gain further understanding of team resilience as a process, this measurement could be used in future process-oriented research examining adverse events and sports team's pre- and postadversity functioning.

A., {\&} Eklund, R. C. (2002). Assessing flow in physical activity: The Flow State Scale-2 and Dispositional Flow State Scale-2. Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, 24, 133-115] and to assess the relationships between athletes' flow state and perceived goal attainment. Design: Cross-sectional with self-reported questionnaires. Method: Two samples of sport participants completed the FSS-2 immediately after an event and within a few days after the event, respectively. Data were analyzed with reliability and confirmatory factor analyses as well as with correlational and regression analyses. Results: Results of confirmatory factor analyses on the French FSS-2 replicated the factor structure of the original FSS-2 with the first-order 9-factor and the hierarchical models both displaying adequate level of goodness-of-fit. Results of multi-sample analyses indicated that most parameters of the FSS-2 were invariant across languages. As expected, flow state correlated significantly with goal attainment during a sport competition. The relationship between flow and goal attainment was invariant across levels of competition. Conclusions: This study provided support for the factor structure of the French version of the FSS-2 and for the invariance of the flow construct across languages. Flow state is significantly associated with goal attainment and the relationship is equivalent across athletes' levels of competition. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {High-dimensional data with very few instances are typical in many application domains. Selecting a highly discriminative subset of the original features is often the main interest of the end user. The widely- used feature selection protocol for such type of data consists of two steps. First, features are selected from the data (possibly through cross-validation), and, second, a cross-validation protocol is applied to test a classifier using the selected features. The selected feature set and the testing accuracy are then returned to the user. For the lack of a better option, the same low-sample-size dataset is used in both steps. Questioning the validity of this protocol, we carried out an experiment using 24 high-dimensional datasets, three feature selection methods and five classifier models. We found that the accuracy returned by the above protocol is heavily biased, and therefore propose an alternative protocol which avoids the contamination by including both steps in a single cross-validation loop. Statistical tests verify that the classification accuracy returned by the proper protocol is significantly closer to the true accuracy (esti- mated from an independent testing set) compared to that returned by the currently favoured protocol.},

abstract = {A family of scaling corrections aimed to improve the chi-square approximation of goodness-of-fit test statistics in small samples, large models, aM nonnormal data was proposed in Saton'a and Bentler (1994). For structural equations models, Satorra-Bentler's (SB) scaling con'ections are available in standard computer software. Often, however, the interest is not on the overall fit of a model, but on a test of the restrictions that a null model say Ad O implies on a less restricted one Adl. If To and T 1 denote the goodness-of-fit test statistics associated to AdO and Adl, respectively, then typically the difference Td = To-T1 is used as a chi-square test statistic with degrees of freedom equal to the difference on the number of independent parameters estimated under the models AdO and Adl. As in the case of the goodness-of-fit test, it is of interest to scale the statistic T d in order to improve its chi-squaxe approximation in realistic, that is, nonasymptotic and nonnormal, applications. In a recent paper, Satorra (2000) shows that the difference between two SB scaled test statistics for overall model fit does not yield the correct SB scaled difference test statistic. Satorra developed an expression that permits scaling the difference test statistic, but his formula has some practical limitations, since it requires heavy computations that are not available in standard computer software. The purpose of the present paper is to provide an easy way to compute the scaled difference chi-square statistic t{\~{}}om the scaled goodness-of-fit test statistics of models Ado and Adl. A Monte Carlo study is provided to illustrate the performance of the competing statistics.},

abstract = {The present investigation was designed to extend Weinberg, Gould, and Jackson's (1979) efficacy-performance results to a back-to-back competitive situation as well as to determine whether performance would be affected by the solicitation of public vs. private expectancy statements. Subjects (56 males and 56 females) were randomly assigned to either a high or low self-efficacy condition and either stated their expectancy of success publicly or privately in a 2 × 2 × 2 (sex × self-efficacy × publiclprivate) factorial design. Self-efficacy was manipulated by having subjects compete against a confederate on a muscular leg-endurance task in which the confederate was said to be either a varsity track athlete who exhibited higher performance on a related task (low self-efficacy), or an individual who had a knee injury and exhibited poorer performance on a related task (high self-efficacy). The results supported self-efficacy predictions, and thus extended Weinberg et al.'s findings to a back-to-back competitive situation. The public/private manipulation produced no significant performance effects. In addition, the sex by self-efficacy interaction indicated that the self-efficacy main effect was due primarily to high-efficacy males extending their legs significantly longer than low-efficacy males. These results are discussed in terms of the differing patterns of sex-role socialization.},

abstract = {Although the motivational technique of goal setting has consistently and reliably improved performance in industrial psychology research, this beneficial effect has not been clearly demonstrated in the sport domain. The many proposed explanations for this discrepancy have resulted in a controversy in the literature. However, scientists have overlooked the importance of statistical power. A meta-analytic review of the literature investigating the effects of goal setting on performance in sport and exercise could help to clarify the state of knowledge. The meta-analytic procedures described by Hedges and Olkin (1985) were used to statistically combine 36 studies identified as meeting inclusion criteria. Results indicate that, overall, setting goals improves sport by 0.34 of a standard deviation. Moderate, absolute, and combined short- and long-term goals were associated with the greatest effects. Additional moderator variables were identified, and the extent to which they alter the goal setting–performance relationship is discussed.},

abstract = {Background: Talent identification (TID) programs are an integral part of the selection process for elite-level athletes. While many sport organizations utilize TID programs, there does not seem to be a clear set of variables that consistently predict future success. Objective: This review aims to synthesize longitudinal and retrospective studies examining differences between performance variables in highly skilled and less-skilled athletes in elite-level sport. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to identify relevant studies (N = 20). Results: There was a clear overrepresentation of studies that (1) examined physical profiles of athletes (60{\%}); (2) focused on male samples (65{\%}); (3) examined athletes between the ages of 10 and 20 years (60{\%}); and (4) were published between the years 2010 and 2015 (65{\%}). On closer examination, there was a high degree of variability in the factors that were found to discriminate between skilled and less-skilled individuals. Conclusion: Findings from this review highlight how little is known about TID in elite sport and emphasize the need for greater diversity in TID research.},

abstract = {Comprehensive introduction to the use of models and modeling in science education Focuses explicitly on enhancing science learning Examines the most up-to-date and contemporary research efforts Explores concepts that are vital to the understanding of science teaching The process of developing models, known as modeling, allows scientists to visualize difficult concepts, explain complex phenomena and clarify intricate theories. In recent years, science educators have greatly increased their use of modeling in teaching, especially real-time dynamic modeling, which is central to a scientific investigation. Modeling in science teaching is being used in an array of fields, everything from primary sciences to tertiary chemistry to college physics, and it is sure to play an increasing role in the future of education. Models and Modeling: Cognitive Tools for Scientific Enquiry is a comprehensive introduction to the use of models and modeling in science education. It identifies and describes many different modeling tools and presents recent applications of modeling as a cognitive tool for scientific enquiry. The processes of modelling and the use of the resulting models to inform predictions play key roles in the nature of science and hence in science education, especially in inquiry-based approaches. Against a background of the philosophical basis for modelling and models, the implications for science education are explored. Well-designed and thoroughly classroom-tested schemes to support students in learning how to model are reviewed. Research into teachers' understanding of models and their place in the nature of science are reviewed as are successful strategies for the further development of that knowledge. This book has a major contribution to make to the pre- and in-service education of elementary (primary) and high (secondary) school science teachers.},

Prior studies predominantly used (a) small samples with low power for precise estimation, (b) nonclinical samples, and (c) single samples. This renders network structures in clinical data, and the extent to which networks replicate across data sets, unknown. To overcome these limitations, the present cross-cultural multisite study estimated regularized partial correlation networks of 16 PTSD symptoms across four data sets of traumatized patients receiving treatment for PTSD (total N = 2,782). Despite differences in culture, trauma type, and severity of the samples, considerable similarities emerged, with moderate to high correlations between symptom profiles (0.43–0.82), network structures (0.62–0.74), and centrality estimates (0.63–0.75). We discuss the importance of future replicability efforts to improve clinical psychological science and provide code, model output, and correlation matrices to make the results of this article fully reproducible.},

abstract = {Background Depression severity is assessed in numerous research disciplines, ranging from the social sciences to genetics, and used as a dependent variable, predictor, covariate, or to enroll participants. The routine practice is to assess depression severity with one particular depression scale, and draw conclusions about depression in general, relying on the assumption that scales are interchangeable measures of depression. The present paper investigates to which degree 7 common depression scales differ in their item content and generalizability. Methods A content analysis is carried out to determine symptom overlap among the 7 scales via the Jaccard index (0=no overlap, 1=full overlap). Per scale, rates of idiosyncratic symptoms, and rates of specific vs. compound symptoms, are computed. Results The 7 instruments encompass 52 disparate symptoms. Mean overlap among all scales is low (0.36), mean overlap of each scale with all others ranges from 0.27 to 0.40, overlap among individual scales from 0.26 to 0.61. Symptoms feature across a mean of 3 scales, 40{\%} of the symptoms appear in only a single scale, 12{\%} across all instruments. Scales differ regarding their rates of idiosyncratic symptoms (0–33{\%}) and compound symptoms (22–90{\%}). Limitations Future studies analyzing more and different scales will be required to obtain a better estimate of the number of depression symptoms; the present content analysis was carried out conservatively and likely underestimates heterogeneity across the 7 scales. Conclusion The substantial heterogeneity of the depressive syndrome and low overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a threat to the replicability and generalizability of depression research. Implications and future research opportunities are discussed.},

They identified a number of understandings - bisexuality as a temporary phase on the path to a fully realised lesbian or heterosexual identity and bisexuals as immature, confused, greedy, untrustworthy, highly sexual and incapable of monogamy - which they reported as arising from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities and the wider society.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple reconstructive procedures are common for the reconstruction of complex facial deformities of skin, soft tissues, bony structures, and functional subunits, such as the nose, lips, and eyelids. However, the results have been unsatisfactory. An innovative approach entailing a single surgical procedure of face allograft transplantation is a viable alternative and gives improved results. METHODS: On Dec 9, 2008, a 45-year-old woman with a history of severe midface trauma underwent near-total face transplantation in which 80{\%} of her face was replaced with a tailored composite tissue allograft. We addressed issues of immunosuppressive therapy, psychological and ethical outcomes, and re-integration of the patient into society. FINDINGS: After the operation, the patient did well physically and psychologically, and tolerated immunosuppression without any major complication. Routine biopsy on day 47 after transplantation showed rejection of graft mucosa; however, a single bolus of corticosteroids reversed rejection. During the first 3 weeks after transplantation, the patient accepted her new face; 6 months after surgery, the functional outcome has been excellent. In contrast to her status before transplantation, the patient can now breathe through her nose, smell, taste, speak intelligibly, eat solid foods, and drink from a cup. INTERPRETATION: We show the feasibility of reconstruction of severely disfigured patients in a single surgical procedure using composite face allotransplantation. Therefore, this should be taken in consideration as an early option for severely disfigured patients. FUNDING: None.},

@article{Anguera2018,
abstract = {The literature on mixed methods and multimethods has burgeoned over the last 20 years, and researchers from a growing number and diversity of fields have progressively embraced these approaches. However, rapid growth in any movement inevitably gives rise to gaps or shortcomings, such as “identity crises” or divergent conceptual views. Although some authors draw a clear and sometimes opinionated distinction between mixed methods and multimethods, for others, they are synonymous. The concepts underlying both terms therefore have become blurred and generated much confusion. The aim of this article is to explore the origins of the confusion, describe our view of mixed methods and multimethod studies, and by doing so, help to clearly delineate the two concepts. The authors have presented their opinion of how these terms and concepts should be distinguished and call for a constructive debate of the issues involved in the mixed methods and multimethod literature. This is a way truly to propel the field forward.},

Participants completed measures of coach transformational leadership, personal and teammate inside sacrifice, and task cohesion. After conducting multilevel mediation analysis, we found that both personal and teammate inside sacrifice significantly mediated the relationships between transformational leadership behaviors and task cohesion. However, there were differential patterns of these relationships for male and female athletes. Interpretation of the results highlights that coaches should endeavor to display transformational leadership behaviors as they are related to personal and teammate inside sacrifices and task cohesion.},

abstract = {This study examined the relationship between reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST), life stress, and internalizing symptoms. Generally, low sensitivity of the behavioral approach system (BAS) predicts depression whereas high sensitivity of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) predicts anxiety and depression. However, few studies have examined how RST variables interact with life stress to predict these symptoms. It was hypothesized that higher BIS sensitivity would predict greater anxious arousal; lower BAS sensitivity and higher BIS sensitivity would predict greater anhedonic depression as predicted by the joint subsystems hypothesis (JSH); and low BAS, high BIS, and high life stress would interact to predict anhedonic depression symptoms whereas high BIS with high life stress would predict anxious symptoms. A sample of 285 undergraduates completed measures of RST, life stress, and internalizing symptoms. Greater BIS sensitivity predicted mixed anxiety-depression and anhedonic depressed symptoms, lower BAS predicted anhedonic depression symptoms, and life events predicted mixed anxiety-depression. Three-way interactions indicated that for high life stress, BIS predicted both types of symptoms. For low life stress, low BAS and high BIS predicted anhedonic depression whereas high BIS and high BAS predicted mixed anxiety-depression. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of the JSH. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Techel2016,
abstract = {Avalanche accidents, particularly those resulting in fatalities, attract substantial attention from policy makers and organizations, as well as from the media and the public. Placing fatal accidents in a wider context requires long-term and robust statistics. However, avalanche accident statistics, like most other accident statistics, often rely on relatively small sample sizes, with single multi-fatality events and random effects having a potentially large influence on summary and trend statistics. Additionally, trend interpretation is challenging because statistics are generally explored at a national level, and studies vary in both the period covered and the methods. Here, we addressed these issues by combining the avalanche fatality data from the European Alps (Austria, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Italy, Slovenia, and Switzerland) for three different periods between 1937 and 2015 and applying the same data analysis methodology. During the last four decades, about 100 people lost their lives each year in the Alps. Despite considerable inter-annual variation, this number has remained relatively constant in the last decades. However, exploring fatality numbers by the location of the victims at the time of the avalanche revealed two partly opposing trends. The number of fatalities in controlled terrain (settlements and transportation corridors) has decreased significantly since the 1970s. In contrast to this development, the number of fatalities in uncontrolled terrain (mostly recreational accidents) almost doubled between the 1960s and 1980s and has remained relatively stable since then, despite a strong increase in the number of winter backcountry recreationists. Corresponding to these trends, the proportion of fatalities in uncontrolled terrain increased from 72 to 97 {\%}. These long-term trends were evident in most national statistics. Further, the temporal correlation between subsets of the Alpine fatality data, and between some of the national statistics, suggests that time series covering a longer period may be used as an indicator for missing years in shorter-duration datasets. Finally, statistics from countries with very few incidents should be compared to, or analysed together with, those from neighbouring countries exhibiting similar economical and structural developments and characteristics.},

@article{Ryan1995,
abstract = {ABSTRACT The assumption that there are innate integrative or actualizing tendencies underlying personality and social development is reexamined. Rather than viewing such processes as either nonexistent or as automatic, I argue that they are dynamic and dependent upon social‐contextual supports Pertaining to basic human psychological needs. To develop this viewpoint, I conceptually link the notion of integrative tendencies to specific developmental processes, namely intrinsic motivation; internalization; and emotional integration. These processes are then shown to be facilitated by conditions that fulfill psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, and forestalled within contexts that frustrate these needs. Interactions between psychological needs and contextual supports account, in part, for the domain and situational specificity of motivation, experience, and relative integration. The meaning of psychological needs (vs. wants) is directly considered, as are the relations between concepts of integration and autonomy and those of independence, individualism, efficacy, and cognitive models of “multiple selves.” Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Concurrent inductive and deductive content analysis revealed that, consistent with previous research, younger and older children reported sources of enjoyment such as perceived competence, social involvement and friendships, psychosocial support, and a mastery-oriented learning environment. Nonenjoyment sources included inappropriate psychosocial support, increasing competitive orientation, negative feedback and reinforcement, injuries, pain, and demonstrating a lack of competence. Differences between younger and older children's sources of enjoyment and nonenjoyment also emerged. Younger children reported movement sensations as a source of enjoyment and punishment for skill errors and low informational support as nonenjoyment sources. Older children reported social recognition of competence, encouragement, excitement, and challenge as sources of enjoyment with rivalry, overtraining, and high standards as sources of nonenjoyment. These differences underscore the importance of tailoring youth sport in the sampling years to the needs of the child.},

abstract = {There has been a dramatic growth in the development and application of Bayesian inferential methods. Some of this growth is due to the availability of powerful simulation-based algorithms to summarize posterior distributions. There has been also a growing interest in the use of the system R for statistical analyses. R's open source nature, free availability, and large number of contributor packages have made R the software of choice for many statisticians in education and industry.Bayesian Computation with R introduces Bayesian modeling by the use of computation using the R language. The early chapters present the basic tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and two-parameter inferential problems. Bayesian computational methods such as Laplace's method, rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are illustrated in the context of a random effects model. The construction and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced. These simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and binary response regression, hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference, and robust modeling. Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the posterior predictive distribution. The use of R to interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is described with several illustrative examples.This book is a suitable companion book for an introductory course on Bayesian methods and is valuable to the statistical practitioner who wishes to learn more about the R language and Bayesian methodology. The LearnBayes package, written by the author and available from the CRAN website, contains all of the R functions described in the book.The second edition contains several new topics such as the use of mixtures of conjugate priors and the use of Zellner 's g priors to choose between models in linear regression. There are more illustrations of the construction of informative prior distributions, such as the use of conditional means priors and multivariate normal priors in binary regressions. The new edition contains changes in the R code illustrations according to the latest edition of the LearnBayes package.},

abstract = {Three studies investigated the relevance of affect regulation, stressful life events, and congruence between explicit achievement orientation and implicit achievement motive for subjective well-being and symptom formation. According to personality systems interactions (PSI) theory, stressful life events were expected to reduce motive congruence when the ability to self-regulate affect was impaired (i.e., state orientation). Consistent with expectations, the State Orientation x Stress interaction predicted incongruence in healthy participants (Studies 1 and 3) and in patients (Study 2). Furthermore, incongruence partially mediated the direct State Orientation x Stress effect on subjective well-being (Studies 1 and 3) and the course of psychosomatic complaints over 3 months (Study 2). In Study 3, the experimental induction of threat reduced motive congruence in state-oriented participants compared with an acceptance condition. Findings underscore the importance of assessing motive congruence as a "hidden stressor" and validate a new operant multi-motive test.},

Risk perception was related to both venturesomeness and past risk experiences but the nature of the relationship depended on whether the hazardous activity was voluntary or involuntary. Involuntary risks were more likely to be perceived as more unfamiliar, uncontrollable and involuntary by those who had greater personal experience of hazardous activities. Voluntary risks were more likely to be regarded as better understood and perceived to be assumed as a matter of choice by those who had greater personal experience of hazardous activities. Whilst no significant relationship was established between venturesomeness and perception of voluntary risk activities, it was related to perception of involuntary hazardous activities.

abstract = {Objectives: Based on predictions drawn from self-determination theory (SDT: Deci {\&} Ryan, 2000, The ''what'' and the ''why'' of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior. Psychological Inquiry, 11, 227-268) this study examined specific differential mediating effects of psychological need satisfaction in the relation between support for psychological needs and the internalization of behavioural regulation for exercise. Methods: 133 former female exercise referral scheme clients (mean age ¼ 54.51) completed measures of need support provided by their exercise practitioners, satisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, the latter including measures of interpersonal relatedness and social assimilation, and behavioural regulations for exercise. Results: Multiple mediator regression analyses showed that when need support promoted autonomy and social assimilation, individuals were less amotivated and less externally regulated. Fostering personal relatedness whilst not fostering autonomy was associated with greater introjected regulation but promoting social assimilation served to partially offset this negative effect. When need support facilitated autonomy, competence and personal relatedness, identified regulation was promoted. Satisfaction of autonomy and competence needs mediated the association between need support and intrinsic regulation. Conclusions: The results support the central role afforded to autonomy in SDT and indicate that autonomy does not have to be actively undermined in order to forestall the internalization process. In practical terms, in addition to promoting autonomy and competence, exercise practitioners should help referral schemes clients to assimilate into the social environment of exercise facilities as well as ensuring that they receive more direct interpersonal support.},

The sample was made up of 98 Bulgarian top athletes (35 females and 63 males). Participants' athletic performances in national and international events over the last two years was documented. Participants also completed the Bulgarian version of the Sport Motivation Scale (Bri{\`{e}}re, Vallerand, Blais, {\&} Pelletier, in press; Pelletier, Fortier, Vallerand, Tuson, Bri{\`{e}}re, {\&} Blais, 1995). The SAIS, which is based on the tenets of Self-Determination Theory (Deci {\&} Ryan, 1985, 1991), assesses: intrinsic motivation, self-determined extrinsic motivation, non-self-determined extrinsic motivation, and amotivation. Results indicated that, in comparison with less successful athletes, title and medal holders displayed higher levels of non-self-determined extrinsic motivation and higher levels of amotivation. With respect to gender, the motivation of female athletes was more strongly characterized by intrinsic motivation. Results are dicussed in light of Self-Determination Theory and the cultural context which prevailed in Bulgaria at the time of the investigation. It is concluded that these results highlight the role of motivation in elite sport performance.},

Three types of catalysts help or hinder that process: (a) interpersonal (I) catalysts, like personal traits and self-management processes; (b) environmental (E) catalysts, like socio-demographic factors. psychological influences (e.g., from parents, teachers, or peers), or special talent development facilities and programs: and (c) chance (C). The DMGT includes a 5-level metric-based (MB) system to operationalize the prevalence of gifted or talented individuals, with a basic 'top 10 per cent' threshold for mild giftedness or talent, through successive 10 per cent cuts for moderate, high. exceptional and extreme levels. Complex interactions between the six components are surveyed.

Our results based on 584 effect sizes from 88 independent samples representing 66,807 individuals indicate that the higher order structure of grit is not confirmed, that grit is only moderately correlated with performance and retention, and that grit is very strongly correlated with conscientiousness. We also find that the perseverance of effort facet has significantly stronger criterion validities than the consistency of interest facet and that perseverance of effort explains variance in academic performance even after controlling for conscientiousness. In aggregate our results suggest that interventions designed to enhance grit may only have weak effects on performance and success, that the construct validity of grit is in question, and that the primary utility of the grit construct may lie in the perseverance facet.

The purpose of this review is to discuss three commonly used ways to demonstrate rigor when conducting or judging qualitative research in sport and exercise psychology. These are the method of member checking, the method of inter-rater reliability, and the notion of universal criteria. Problems with each method are first highlighted. Member checking and inter-rater reliability are shown to be ineffective for verification, trustworthiness, or reliability purposes. Next, universal criteria within the context of Tracy's, heavily drawn on paper within sport and exercise psychology is problematized. Throughout the discussion of each method and universal criteria more suitable possibilities for conducting rigorous qualitative research are offered. The paper concludes that to support high- quality qualitative research, scholars – including journal editors and reviewers – need to change how rigor is developed and judged, rather than perpetuate the problems with how it has been commonly evaluated in the past. Recommendations for developing rigor when conducting and/or judging qualitative research within sport and exercise psychology are also offered.},

abstract = {This study investigated the longitudinal effects of the Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) and the Behavioral Activation System (BAS) on anxiety symptomatology and tested the indirect effect of cognitive emotion regulation as a possible mechanism underlying this link. In this study, 274 individuals were assessed two times (T1 and T2), at a 5-year interval. We found an excellent fit for the hypothesized model, with BIS (T1) predicting both maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation (mCER) and T2-anxiety even after controlling for T1-anxiety. Further, mCER significantly mediated the relationship between BIS and T2-anxiety, and between T1-anxiety and T2-anxiety. However, an alternative model, supposing that BIS and T1-anxiety indirectly affect mCER through T2-anxiety, showed a similar fit. While BAS predicted higher levels of adaptive cognitive emotion regulation (aCER), it was unrelated to mCER and showed a small positive association with anxiety only at higher levels of BIS. These findings provide longitudinal support for BIS as a risk for anxiety symptoms and support the importance of targeting mCER in the prevention and treatment of anxiety, especially among individuals with BIS sensitivity. Finally, the results suggest a possible overlap between anxiety and mCER that requires further longitudinal research to clarify the direction of their relationship.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The impact of uncontrollability and failure on adult males and females in a learned helplessness situation was investigated. It was hypothesized that females would show more helplessness effects. Twenty-four males and 24 females enrolled in a university psychology course were studied. Helplessness was induced through a series of anagram tasks used in earlier research by one of the authors. As expected, females showed more helplessness effects in the helplessness-induction manipulations of the anagram tasks. Discussion is offered in terms of possible sex differences in childhood training with regard to handling frustration and failure.

abstract = {Although affective science has seen an explosion of interest in measuring subjectively experienced distinct emotional states, most existing self-report measures tap broad affect dimensions and dispositional emotional tendencies, rather than momentary distinct emotions. This raises the question of how emotion researchers are measuring momentary distinct emotions in their studies. To address this question, we reviewed the self-report measurement practices regularly used for the purpose of assessing momentary distinct emotions, by coding these practices as observed in a representative sample of articles published in Emotion from 2001–2011 (n ϭ 467 articles; 751 studies; 356 measurement instances). This quanti-tative review produced several noteworthy findings. First, researchers assess many purportedly distinct emotions (n ϭ 65), a number that differs substantially from previously developed emotion taxonomies. Second, researchers frequently use scales that were not systematically developed, and that include items also used to measure at least 1 other emotion on a separate scale in a separate study. Third, the majority of scales used include only a single item, and had unknown reliability. Together, these tactics may create ambiguity regarding which emotions are being measured in empirical studies, and conceptual inconsis-tency among measures of purportedly identical emotions across studies. We discuss the implications of these problematic practices, and conclude with recommendations for how the field might improve the way it measures emotions.},

abstract = {Objectives: Recent research suggests that experiencing some adversity can have beneficial outcomes for human growth and development. The purpose of this paper was to explore the adversities that the world's best athletes encounter and the perceived role that these experiences play in their psychological and performance development. Design: A qualitative design was employed because detailed information of rich quality was required to better understand adversity-related experiences in the world's best athletes. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 Olympic gold medalists from a variety of sports. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Results: The findings indicate that the participants encountered a range of sport- and non-sport adversities that they considered were essential for winning their gold medals, including repeated non-selection, significant sporting failure, serious injury, political unrest, and the death of a family member. The participants described the role that these experiences played in their psychological and performance development, specifically focusing on their resultant trauma, motivation, and learning. Conclusions: Adversity-related experiences were deemed to be vital in the psychological and performance development of Olympic champions. In the future, researchers should conduct more in-depth comparative studies of Olympic athletes' adversity- and growth-related experiences, and draw on existing and alternative theoretical explanations of the growth-performance relationship. For professional practitioners, adversity-related experiences offer potential developmental opportunities if they are carefully and purposely harnessed.},

abstract = {Rapid extrication within 10-20 minutes of complete avalanche burial is essential for survival (Haegeli et al. 2011). Safety equipment, along with basic risk prevention measures, is known to decrease the mortality of avalanche burial (Brugger et al. 2007). An accurate estimation of the number of recreationists within a precise geographic region and timeframe is lacking due to feasibility issues of in- field surveys. The aim was to perform a comprehensive survey of backcountry skiers and snowshoers to characterize adherence behaviors in these activity groups. The survey was completed over a 1-week period in February 2011 in South Tyrol, Italy. In total 5576 individuals (77.7{\%} skiers, 22.3{\%} snowshoers) were surveyed. 75.6{\%} of individuals reported having read the avalanche bulletin for the given day, although only 53.4{\%} were able to indicate the correct avalanche danger rating. 80.6{\%} of skiers and 13.7{\%} of snowshoers (p{\textless}0.001) were in possession of standard rescue equipment (transceiver, probe and shovel). The percentage of individuals reporting both correct danger rating and standard equipment was lower (skiers 51.0{\%}, snowshoers 8.3{\%}; p{\textless}0.001). Other survival devices were less frequent (Airbag 3.6{\%}; AvaLung 0.4{\%}). These results highlight a surprisingly low adherence to basic safety measures in a region with a high level of avalanche awareness and a highly organized mountain rescue service. This indicates the need to assess the effectiveness of information-transfer and to tailor educational campaigns to specific recreation groups. A trans-national survey over a complete winter season is needed to allow a reliable calculation of morbidity and mortality in these sports. 1.},

abstract = {Background: Self-efficacy theory proposes that girls who have confidence in their capability to be physically active will perceive fewer barriers to physical activity or be less influenced by them, be more likely to pursue perceived benefits of being physically active, and be more likely to enjoy physical activity. Self-efficacy is theorized also to influence physical activity through self-management strategies (e.g., thoughts, goals, plans, and acts) that support physical activity, but this idea has not been empirically tested. Methods: Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the factorial validity of a measure of self-management strategies for physical activity. Next, the construct validity of the measure was tested by examining whether self-management strategies mediated the relationship between self-efficacy and self-reported physical activity, independently of several social-cognitive variables (i.e., perceived barriers, outcome expectancy value, and enjoyment), among cross-sectional samples of 6th grade (n=309) and 8th grade (n=296) girls tested between February 14 and March 17, 2002. Data were analyzed in 2004. Results: Consistent with theory, self-efficacy had direct effects on the social-cognitive variables. The primary novel finding is that self-management strategies mediated the association of self-efficacy with physical activity in both samples. Conclusions: The measure of self-management strategies for physical activity yields valid scores among adolescent girls and warrants experimental study as a mediator of the influence of efficacy beliefs on physical activity. ?? 2005 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

In Study 1, 484 UK Royal Marine recruits completed questionnaires about their trainers' leadership behaviors and their own attitudes towards training. Training outcome was measured as successful completion of training or non-completion. Discriminant function analyses identified that fostering acceptance of group goals, inspirational motivation, appropriate role model, individual consideration, and contingent reward significantly discriminated between pass and failure. A separate discriminant function analyses revealed that the attitudinal variables of self-confidence, resilience, and satisfaction also successfully discriminated between pass and failure. Study 2 used a true experimental design to examine the effectiveness of a transformational leadership intervention. Participants were 85 experimental and 67 control recruits who completed questionnaires at weeks 5 and 15 of recruit training. Results revealed that 3 of the 5 key leadership behaviors, and all of the 3 recruit attitudinal variables measured, were significantly enhanced by the intervention. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Low conscientiousness and low agreeableness were found to be valid and generalizable predictors of accident involvement, with corrected mean validities of .27 and .26, respectively. The context of the accident acts as a moderator in the personality–accident relationship, with different personality dimensions associated with occupational and non-occupational accidents.

All three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. The major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. In conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. With a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. A summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context.

There have been recent changes in diagnostic criteria for PTSD and there are a number of treatment options available.$\backslash$nSources of data This review is based on published literature in the field of PTSD, its management and the recently published DSM-V.$\backslash$nAreas of agreement The most influential risk factors relate to the post-incident environment rather than pre-incident or the incident itself. There are two established and effective psychological therapies; trauma-focussed cognitive behavioural therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.$\backslash$nAreas of controversy It is unclear what actually constitutes a traumatic event. Psychological debriefing or counselling interventions, shortly after trauma-exposure are found to be ineffective and may cause harm. Medication, whilst common practice, is not recommended as first line management.$\backslash$nGrowing points Future psychotherapies for PTSD may be just as effective if delivered in carefully considered group settings or through remote means.$\backslash$nAreas timely for developing research Research into the most effective ways to prevent individuals at risk of developing PTSD is still at an early stage and development of effective early interventions could substantially reduce the morbidity associated with PTSD.},

In this paper, we propose a stochastic framework to analyze a file-swarming system under realistic setting: constraints in upload/download capacity, collaboration among peers and incentive for chunk exchange. We first extend the results in the coupon system [L. Massoulie, M. Vojnovic, Coupon replication systems, in: Proc. ACM SIGMETRICS, Banff, Alberta, Canada, 2005] by providing a tighter performance bound. Then we generalize the coupon system by considering peers with limited upload and download capacity. We illustrate the last-piece problem and show the effectiveness of using forward error-correction (FEC) code and/or multiple requests to improve the performance. Lastly, we propose a framework to analyze an incentive-based file-swarming system. The stochastic framework we propose can serve as a basis for other researchers to analyze and design more advanced features of file-swarming systems. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE We applied the self-determination theory of human motivation to examine whether patient perceptions of autonomy supportiveness (i.e., patient centeredness) from their diabetes care providers related to improved glucose control over a 12-month period. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study of patients with diabetes from a diabetes treatment center at a university-affiliated community hospital. Participants were 128 patients between 18 and 80 years of age who took medication for diabetes, had no other major medical illnesses, and were responsible for monitoring their glucose and taking their medications. The main outcome measure was a change in HbA1c values over the 12 months of the study RESULTS Patient perception of autonomy support from a health care provider related to a change in HbA1c values at 12 months (P {\textless} 0.05). Further analyses showed that perceived autonomy support from the staff related to significant increases in patient autonomous motivation at 12 months (P {\textless} 0.05); that increases in autonomous motivation related to significant increases in perceived competence (P {\textless} 0.05); and that increases in a patient's perceived competence related to significant reductions in their HbA1c values over 12 months (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The findings support the prediction of the self-determination theory that patients with diabetes whose health care providers are autonomy supportive will become more motivated to regulate their glucose levels, feel more able to regulate their glucose, and show improvements in their HbA1c values.},

abstract = {Association studies have identified dozens of genetic variants linked to training responses and sport-related traits. However, no intervention studies utilizing the idea of personalised training based on athlete's genetic profile have been conducted. Here we propose an algorithm that allows achieving greater results in response to high- or low-intensity resistance training programs by predicting athlete's potential for the development of power and endurance qualities with the panel of 15 performance-associated gene polymorphisms. To develop and validate such an algorithm we performed two studies in independent cohorts of male athletes (study 1: athletes from different sports (n=28); study 2: soccer players (n=39)). In both studies athletes completed an eight-week high- or low-intensity resistance training program, which either matched or mismatched their individual genotype. Two variables of explosive power and aerobic fitness, as measured by the countermovement jump (CMJ) and aerobic 3-min cycle test (Aero3) were assessed pre and post 8 weeks of resistance training. In study 1, the athletes from the matched groups (i.e. high-intensity trained with power genotype or low-intensity trained with endurance genotype) significantly increased results in CMJ (P=0.0005) and Aero3 (P=0.0004). Whereas, athletes from the mismatched group (i.e. high-intensity trained with endurance genotype or low- intensity trained with power genotype) demonstrated non-significant improvements in CMJ (P=0.175) and less prominent results in Aero3 (P=0.0134). In study 2, soccer players from the matched group also demonstrated significantly greater (P{\textless}0.0001) performance changes in both tests compared to the mismatched group. Among non- or low responders of both studies, 82{\%} of athletes (both for CMJ and Aero3) were from the mismatched group (P{\textless}0.0001). Our results indicate that matching the individual's genotype with the appropriate training modality leads to more effective resistance training. The developed algorithm may be used to guide individualised resistance-training},

abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of the study was to provide an in-depth analysis of how the Physical Education (PE) teaching context influences teachers' motivational strategies towards students. Design: Qualitative semi-structured interviews. Methods: Using Self-determination theory (Deci, E. L., {\&} Ryan, R. M. (2000). Psychological Enquiry, 11, 227-268) as a guiding framework, semi-structured interviews of 22 PE teachers were examined using categorical content analysis. Results: The teachers perceived that an emphasis on student assessment and the time constraints associated with PE lessons often compelled them to use teaching strategies which conflicted with their beliefs about the most appropriate ways to motivate students. The teachers' own performance evaluations and pressure to conform to other teachers' methods also influenced the teachers' motivational strategies, but these influences were often congruent with their teaching beliefs. Additionally, the teachers discussed how perceived cultural norms associated with the teacher-student relationship impacted upon their chosen motivational strategies. These cultural norms were reported by different teachers as either in line, or in conflict with their teaching beliefs. Finally, the influence of the teachers' perceptions of their students helped produce strategies that were congruent with their beliefs, but often different to empirically suggested strategies. Conclusions: It is important that teacher beliefs are targeted in education programs and that the teaching context aid in facilitating adaptive motivational strategies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In Study 1, involving late adolescents from Belgium and China (total N = 685; Mean age = 17 years), autonomy and competence satisfaction had unique associations with well-being and individual differences in need valuation did not moderate these associations. Study 2 involved participants from four culturally diverse nations (Belgium, China, USA, and Peru; total N = 1,051; Mean age = 20 years). Results provided evidence for the measurement equivalence of an adapted scale tapping into both need satisfaction and need frustration. Satisfaction of each of the three needs was found to contribute uniquely to the prediction of well-being, whereas frustration of each of the three needs contributed uniquely to the prediction of ill-being. Consistent with Study 1, the effects of need satisfaction and need frustration were found to be equivalent across the four countries and were not moderated by individual differences in the desire for need satisfaction. These findings underscore BPNT's universality claim, which states that the satisfaction of basic needs for autonomy, relatedness, and competence represent essential nutrients for optimal functioning across cultures and across individual differences in need strength.},

What made us think that self-determination theory (SDT) might provide a sort of foundation for the rest of personality psychology? For readers unfamiliar with SDT, we then provide a historical overview that covers the evolution of the six “mini-theories” that currently compose SDT: cognitive evaluation theory, causality orientations theory, organismic integration theory, basic psychological needs theory, goal contents theory, and relational motivation theory. Following each section are preliminary suggestions about how each mini-theory might be useful or informative in other branches of personality. This special issue contains nine articles, each of which makes its own attempt to newly link its area of personality research to SDT. Even if SDT is not the appropriate seed for greater consilience in personality psychology, we urge the field not to neglect the search for unifying principles (Sheldon, Cheng, {\&} Hilpert, 2011); it may finally be time to renew the search for a “grand theory” in personality.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose-Underuse of oral anticoagulation in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is common; however, it remains unknown how it varies geographically. The objective of this study was to evaluate geographic variation in oral anticoagulation use and in the initiation of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Methods-Using 2013 to 2014 claims data from a 5{\%} random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, we identified patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who initiated NOACs (n=8659), warfarin (n=11 771) or no oral anticoagulation therapy (n=18 226) in 2013 to 2014. Each patient was assigned to 1 of the 306 Dartmouth hospital-referral regions based on his/her zip code. We constructed logistic regressions to calculate the mean adjusted probability of initiating oral anticoagulation and the mean adjusted probability of initiating an NOAC among patients on oral anticoagulation in each hospital-referral region, after adjustment for demographic, clinical, and provider characteristics and type of insurance. Finally, we computed the correlation between 2 probabilities. Results-Higher in the Midwest (0.54) and Northeast (0.54) and lowest in the South (0.47), the mean adjusted probability of initiating oral anticoagulation was 0.51, ranging from 0.32 to 0.72. The mean adjusted probability of being prescribed an NOAC among those on oral anticoagulation was 0.42 and was highest in the South (0.50) and lowest in the Midwest (0.36) and Northeast (0.39). In areas with the lower use of oral anticoagulation, patients on any oral anticoagulation therapy had a higher likelihood of being prescribed an NOAC (correlation coefficient,-0.16; P=0.006). Conclusions-Large geographic variation exists in oral anticoagulation use in atrial fibrillation. The use of oral anticoagulation is lower in the South, where the rates of stroke are unusually high. In the future, it will be important to analyze whether the high rates of stroke in the South can be partially attributed to the underuse of oral anticoagulation in this region.},

abstract = {Objectives: This paper urges revision of the way attributions are conceptualised, investigated, and applied in sport psychology. There has been a recent decline in attribution research in sport psychology, despite the generally accepted relevance of attributions in applied settings. In seeking closer links between attribution theory, research, and practice, we argue that there is a mismatch between research and practice in sport psychology. Methods: Relevant literature is reviewed and theoretical arguments offered within seven sub-headings: Attribution theory in practice; linking consistency, distinctiveness, and consensus information to attribution dimensions; controllability as the primary attribution dimension; the generalisability of controllability; assessing attributions; implications for practice; and the social context. Results and conclusions: Research within sport psychology should focus on the central issue of how controllability attributions generalise across time, situations, and people. Measurement should reflect this approach to research within the field of attributions and, to this end, researchers might consider using a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods of inquiry. Practitioners should use consistency, distinctiveness, and consensus information to challenge clients' attributional thinking and help them attain adaptive perceptions of controllability. Practitioners should also help clients to be their own psychologist. Future research and practice should include a consideration of the social context in which attributions are shaped. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Teachers' healthy and effective functioning at work is impacted by the demands they face and the resources they can access. In this study, person-centered analysis was adopted to identify distinct teacher profiles of demands and resources. We investigated teachers' experiences of two job demands (barriers to professional development and disruptive student behavior), two job resources (teacher collaboration and input in decision-making), and one personal resource (self-efficacy for teaching). Using data from the Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) 2013, the study involved 6,411 teachers from 369 schools in Australia and 2,400 teachers from 154 schools in England. In phase one, latent profile analysis revealed five teacher profiles that were similar across the two countries: the Low-Demand-Flourisher (12{\%}), Mixed-Demand-Flourisher (17{\%}), Job-Resourced-Average (34{\%}), Balanced-Average (15{\%}), and Struggler (21{\%}). The profiles were differently associated with two background characteristics (teacher gender and teaching experience) and two work-related well-being outcomes (job satisfaction and occupational commitment). In phase two, we extended our analysis to the school-level to identify school profiles based on the relative prevalence of the five teacher profiles within a school. Indeed, a yield of large scale datasets such as TALIS is that there are sufficient units at the school-level to enable institutional insights, beyond insights garnered at the individual teacher-level. Two school profiles that were similar in both countries were revealed: the Unsupportive school profile (58{\%}) and the Supportive school profile (42{\%}). The Supportive school profile was associated with higher school-average teacher job satisfaction and occupational commitment than the Unsupportive school profile. Taken together, the findings yield knowledge about salient teacher and school profiles, and provide guidance for possible interventions at the teacher- and school level.},

abstract = {Background: Structural equation modeling developed as a statistical melding of path analysis and factor analysis that obscured a fundamental tension between a factor preference for multiple indicators and path modeling's openness to fewer indicators. Discussion: Multiple indicators hamper theory by unnecessarily restricting the number of modeled latents. Using the few best indicators-possibly even the single best indicator of each latent-encourages development of theoretically sophisticated models. Additional latent variables permit stronger statistical control of potential confounders, and encourage detailed investigation of mediating causal mechanisms.},

All experiments showed that participants could produce significantly better physical performances when recalling anger or happiness emotions in contrast to the emotion-neutral state. Experiments 1 and 2 also revealed that physical performance in the anger and the happiness conditions was significantly enhanced compared with the anxiety and the sadness conditions.

We disentangle conflicting definitions of moderated mediation and describe approaches for estimating and testing a variety of hypotheses involving conditional indirect effects.We introduce standard errors for hypothesis testing and construction of confidence intervals in large samples but advocate that researchers use bootstrapping whenever possible. We also describe methods for probing sig- nificant conditional indirect effects by employing direct extensions of the simple slopes method and Johnson-Neyman technique for probing significant interactions. Finally, we provide an SPSS macro to facilitate the implementation of the recom- mended asymptotic and bootstrapping methods. We illustrate the application of these methods with an example drawn from the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transitions, showing that the indirect effect of intrinsic student interest on mathematics performance through teacher perceptions of talent is moderated by student math self-concept.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we provide an overview of measures of self-conscious emotions (embar-rassment, guilt, pride, and shame). The goal of the chapter is to help researchers identify and select measures of self-conscious emotions that meet their diverse needs. Self-conscious emotions are typically assessed through either self-report scales or coding of nonverbal behavior. We first summarize the extant self-report measures and then describe nonverbal coding schemes for each self-conscious emotion previously found to have a recognizable nonverbal expression (i.e., embarrassment, pride, and shame). In this section, we summarize the self-report measures available for shame (and humilia-tion), guilt, embarrassment, and pride. For each emotion, we organize the available mea-sures into three sections: (1) trait or dispositional scales, (2) state or online feeling scales, and (3) state and trait scales of related constructs. Within each of the three sections, the scales are ordered chronologically, by date of publication. Reflecting the field's tendency to focus on clinically relevant emotions, considerably more effort has been devoted to de-veloping self-report measures of shame and guilt than pride or embarrassment. As a re-sult, the vast majority of scales included here assess shame and guilt. For each specific scale, we provide (1) relevant references; (2) a brief description of the scale and the way it was developed; (3) an indication of whether the scale is " fre-quently used, " " occasionally used, " or " rarely used, " based on a citation analysis of the scale name and relevant publications (" frequently used " = cited at least 50 times; " rarely 443},

" Focusing on the positive, we present an overview of the different empirical conceptions of the two forms of perfectionism and present a common framework for the two basic approaches: the dimensional approach differentiating two dimensions of perfectionism (perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns) and the group-based approach differentiating two groups of perfectionists (healthy perfectionists and unhealthy perfectionists). Moreover, we review the evidence demonstrating that (a) perfectionistic strivings are associated with positive characteristics and (b) healthy perfectionists show higher levels of positive characteristics compared to unhealthy perfectionists and nonperfectionists. While questions on core facets, positive effects, and developmental antecedents of positive forms of perfectionism remain, our findings suggest that self-oriented perfectionistic strivings are positive, if perfectionists are not overly concerned about mistakes and negative evaluations by others.},

Studies in two countries found that the NGSE scale has higher construct validity than the SGSE scale. Although shorter than the SGSE scale, the NGSE scale demonstrated high reliability, predicted specific self-efficacy (SSE) for a variety of tasks in various contexts, and moderated the influence of previous performance on subsequent SSE formation. Implications, limitations, and directions for future organizational research are discussed.},

abstract = {Headline findings  Around nine in ten members of the English adult population visited the outdoors at least once in the last twelve months, while around two-fifths had taken a visit within the last seven days.  It is estimated that between March 2013 and February 2014, the 42.3 million adults resident in England took a total of 2.93 billion visits to the natural environment1. The majority were taken to destinations within towns/cities (1.36 billion) or countryside locations (1.31 billion).  Around a quarter of visits involved some form of expenditure – resulting in an estimated spend of {\pounds}17 billion between March 2013 and February 2014.  Parks in towns and cities were the most frequently visited destination type, accounting for 778 million visits.  Walking was by far the most frequently undertaken activity. Half of visits (an estimated 1.5 billion visits) involved walking with a dog while around a quarter (an estimated 775 million visits) involved walking without a dog.  Three-quarters of visits were less than two hours in duration, while two-thirds involved walking to the visit destination. Almost four-fifths were taken within two miles of the visit start point.  Visiting the natural environment for health or exercise accounted for an estimated 1.3 billion visits to the natural environment between March 2013 and February 2014. Factors relating to a lack of time were most likely to be cited as reasons for not visiting more often or at all. At face value, evidence of correlations between life satisfaction, self-worth, happiness and lower levels of anxiety with the regularity with which a person visits the natural environment seem to be apparent. However, as the relationship is merely associative, whether frequency of visiting natural environments influences well-being or having higher well-being causes more natural environment visits, is unclear.},

Methods and Results-Using the Get With The Guidelines-Heart Failure Registry, we linked clinical data from 16 052 heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (ejection fraction ≤40{\%}) patients with Medicare claims data. We divided ACEi/ARB-eligible patients into 4 categories based on admission and discharge ACEi/ARB use: continued (reference group), started, discontinued, or not started on therapy. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the association between ACEi/ARB category and outcomes. Most, 90.5{\%}, were discharged on ACEi/ARB (59.6{\%} continued and 30.9{\%} newly started). Of those discharged without ACEi/ARB, 1.9{\%} were discontinued, and 7.5{\%} were eligible but not started. Thirty-day mortality was 3.5{\%} for patients continued and 4.1{\%} for patients started on ACEi/ARB. In contrast, 30-day mortality was 8.8{\%} for patients discontinued (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj] 1.92; 95{\%} CI 1.32-2.81; P {\textless} 0.001) and 7.5{\%} for patients not started (HRadj 1.50; 95{\%} CI 1.12-2.00; P=0.006). The 30-day readmission rate was lowest among patients continued or started on therapy. One-year mortality was 28.2{\%} for patients continued and 29.7{\%} for patients started on ACEi/ARB compared to 41.6{\%} for patients discontinued (HRadj 1.35; 95{\%} CI 1.13-1.61; P {\textless} 0.001) and 41.7{\%} (HRadj 1.28; 95{\%} CI 1.14-1.43; P {\textless} 0.001) for patients not started on therapy.

abstract = {Context. The benefits of continuity of pediatric care remain controversial. Objective. To determine whether there is an association between having a continuous relationship with a primary care pediatric provider and decreased risk of emergency department (ED) visitation and hospitalization. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Population. We used claims data from 46 097 pediatric patients enrolled at Group Health Cooperative, a large staff-model health maintenance organization, between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 1998, for our analysis. To be eligible, patients had to have been continuously enrolled for at least a 2-year period or since birth and to have made at least 4 visits to one of the Group Health Cooperative clinics. Main Exposure Variable. A continuity of care (COC) index that quantifies the degree to which a patient has experienced continuous care with a provider. Main Outcome Measures. ED utilization and hospitalization. Results. Compared with children with the highest COC, children with medium continuity were more likely to have visited the ED (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.28 [1.20-1.36]) and more likely to be hospitalized (HR: 1.22 [1.09-1.38]). Children with the lowest COC were even more likely to have visited the ED (HR: 1.58 [1.49-1.66]) and to be hospitalized (HR: 1.54 [1.33-1.75]). These risks were even greater for children on Medicaid and those with asthma. Conclusions. Lower continuity of primary care is associated with higher risk of ED utilization and hospitalization. Efforts to improve and maintain continuity may be warranted.},

abstract = {Introduction: Beyond clinical trials, clinical practice guidelines, and administrative regulation, treatment decision-making can be influenced by individual and contextual factors. Our goal was to describe variations in the patterns of initiation of anticoagulation therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation by Health Areas (HA) in the region of Valencia in Spain and to quantify the influence of the HAs on variations in treatment choice. Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of all atrial fibrillation patients who started treatment with oral anticoagulants between November 2011 and February 2014 in each of the region's 24 HAs. We described patient and utilization characteristics per HA and initiation patterns over time, and we identified contextual and individual factors associated with differences in initiation patterns. Results: 21,879 patients initiated treatment with an oral anticoagulant in the 24 HAs. Initiation with direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) in the first year was 14.6{\%}. In November 2013 the ratio was 25.4{\%}, with HA ratios ranging from 3.8 to 57.1{\%}. DOAC-initiating patients had less comorbidity but were more likely to present episodes of previous ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or TIA when compared with patients initiating with VKA treatment. Variability among HAs was statistically significant, with the majority of HAs ranking above or below the regional initiation average (ICC ≈ 8{\%}). Conclusion: There was high variability in the percentage of DOAC initiation and in the choice of DOAC among HAs. Interventions aimed to improve DOAC initiation decision-making and to reduce variations should take into account the Health Area component.},

Routinely collected UK primary care data have previously been used for national pandemic surveillance, quantifying associations between exposures and outcomes, identifying highrisk populations and examining the effects of interventions at scale. However, there is no consensus on how to effectively conduct or report these data for COVID-19 research. A COVID-19 primary care database consortium was established in April 2020. Collectively, its researchers have ongoing COVID19 projects in overlapping datasets with millions of primary care records representing 30{\%} of the UK population, that are variously linked to public health, secondary care and vital status records. This consensus agreement is aimed at facilitating transparency and rigour in methodological approaches, as well as consistency in defining and reporting cases, exposures, confounders, stratification variables and outcomes in relation to the pharmacoepidemiology of COVID-19.

abstract = {Purpose of Review: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the aggressive coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Recently, investigators have stipulated that COVID-19 patients receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) may be subject to poorer outcomes. This editorial presents the available evidence to guide treatment practices during this pandemic. Recent Findings: Recent studies from Wuhan cohorts provide valuable information about COVID-19. A cohort with 52 critically ill patients revealed cardiac injury in 12{\%} of patients. Worse outcomes appear to be more prevalent in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), possibly due to overexpression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in airway alveolar epithelial cells. Investigators suspect that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor to enter the lungs in a mechanism similar to SARS-CoV. Several hypotheses have been proposed to date regarding the net effect of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 infections. Positive effects include ACE2 receptor blockade, disabling viral entry into the heart and lungs, and an overall decrease in inflammation secondary to ACEI/ARB. Negative effects include a possible retrograde feedback mechanism, by which ACE2 receptors are upregulated. Summary: Even though physiological models of SARS-CoV infection show a theoretical benefit of ACEI/ARB, these findings cannot be extrapolated to SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19. Major cardiology scientific associations, including ACC, HFSA, AHA, and ESC Hypertension Council, have rejected these correlation hypotheses. After an extensive literature review, we conclude that there is no significant evidence to support an association for now, but given the rapid evolvement of this pandemic, findings may change.},

abstract = {Mixture modeling is a widely applied data analysis technique used to identify unobserved heterogeneity in a population. Despite mixture models' usefulness in practice, one unresolved issue in the application of mixture models is that there is not one commonly accepted statistical indicator for deciding on the number of classes in a study population. This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the performance of likelihood-based tests and the traditionally used Information Criterion (ICs) used for determining the number of classes in mixture modeling. We look at the performance of these tests and indexes for 3 types of mixture models: latent class analysis (LCA), a factor mixture model (FMA), and a growth mixture models (GMM). We evaluate the ability of the tests and indexes to correctly identify the number of classes at three different sample sizes (n = 200, 500, 1,000). Whereas the Bayesian Information Criterion performed the best of the ICs, the bootstrap likelihood ratio test proved to be a very consistent indicator of classes across all of the models considered.

abstract = {Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of {\textgreater}2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

abstract = {Purpose of the review: The ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China is lifting widespread concerns. Thus, therapeutic options are urgently needed, and will be discussed in this review. Recent findings: Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process. Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses. Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators. For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed. Summary: For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.},

abstract = {Background: The widely used OpenPrescribing.net service provides standard measures which compare prescribing of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and English General Practices against that of their peers. Detecting changes in prescribing behaviour compared with peers can help identify missed opportunities for medicines optimisation. Automating the process of detecting these changes is necessary due to the volume of data, but challenging due to variation in prescribing volume for different measures and locations. We set out to develop and implement a method of detecting change on all individual prescribing measures, in order to notify CCGs and practices of such changes in a timely manner. Methods: We used the statistical process control method CUSUM to detect prescribing behaviour changes in relation to population trends for the individual standard measures on OpenPrescribing. Increases and decreases in percentile were detected separately, using a multiple of standard deviation as the threshold for detecting change. The algorithm was modified to continue re-triggering when trajectory persists. It was deployed, user-tested, and summary statistics generated on the number of alerts by CCG and practice. Results: The algorithm detected changes in prescribing for 32 prespecified measures, across a wide range of CCG and practice sizes. Across the 209 English CCGs, a mean of 2.5 increase and 2.4 decrease alerts were triggered per CCG, per month. For the 7578 practices, a mean of 1.3 increase and 1.4 decrease alerts were triggered per practice, per month. Conclusions: The CUSUM method appears to effectively discriminate between random noise and sustained change in prescribing behaviour. This method aims to allow practices and CCGs to be informed of important changes quickly, with a view to improve their prescribing behaviour. The number of alerts triggered for CCGs and practices appears to be appropriate. Prescribing behaviour after users are alerted to changes will be monitored in order to assess the impact of these alerts.},

abstract = {Background: OpenPrescribing is a freely accessible service that enables any user to view and analyze the National Health Service (NHS) primary care prescribing data at the level of individual practices. This tool is intended to improve the quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness of prescribing. Objective: We aimed to measure the impact of OpenPrescribing being viewed on subsequent prescribing. Methods: Having preregistered our protocol and code, we measured three different metrics of prescribing quality (mean percentile across 34 existing OpenPrescribing quality measures, available “price-per-unit” savings, and total “low-priority prescribing” spend) to see whether they changed after the viewing of Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and practice pages. We also measured whether practices whose data were viewed on OpenPrescribing differed in prescribing, prior to viewing, compared with those who were not. We used fixed-effects and between-effects linear panel regression to isolate change over time and differences between practices, respectively. We adjusted for the month of prescribing in the fixed-effects model to remove underlying trends in outcome measures. Results: We found a reduction in available price-per-unit savings for both practices and CCGs after their pages were viewed. The saving was greater at practice level (−{\pounds}40.42 per thousand patients per month; 95{\%} CI −54.04 to −26.81) than at CCG level (−{\pounds}14.70 per thousand patients per month; 95{\%} CI −25.56 to −3.84). We estimate a total saving since launch of {\pounds}243 thosand at practice level and {\pounds}1.47 million at CCG level between the feature launch and end of follow-up (August to November 2017) among practices viewed. If the observed savings from practices viewed were extrapolated to all practices, this would generate {\pounds}26.8 million in annual savings for the NHS, approximately 20{\%} of the total possible savings from this method. The other two measures were not different after CCGs or practices were viewed. Practices that were viewed had worse prescribing quality scores overall prior to viewing. Conclusions: We found a positive impact from the use of OpenPrescribing, specifically for the class of savings opportunities that can only be identified by using this tool. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to conduct a robust analysis of the impact of such a Web-based service on clinical practice.},

We aim to describe time trends, variation and factors associated with prescribing gluten-free foods in England. Setting English primary care. Participants English general practices. Primary and secondary outcome measures We described long-term national trends in gluten-free prescribing, and practice and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) level monthly variation in the rate of gluten-free prescribing (per 1000 patients) over time. We used a mixed-effect Poisson regression model to determine factors associated with gluten-free prescribing rate. Results There were 1.3 million gluten-free prescriptions between July 2016 and June 2017, down from 1.8 million in 2012/2013, with a corresponding cost reduction from {\pounds}25.4 million to {\pounds}18.7 million. There was substantial variation in prescribing rates among practices (range 0 to 148 prescriptions per 1000 patients, IQR 7.3-31.8), driven in part by substantial variation at the CCG level, likely due to differences in prescribing policy. Practices in the most deprived quintile of deprivation score had a lower prescribing rate than those in the highest quintile (incidence rate ratio 0.89, 95{\%} CI 0.87 to 0.91). This is potentially a reflection of the lower rate of diagnosed coeliac disease in more deprived populations. Conclusion Gluten-free prescribing is in a state of flux, with substantial clinically unwarranted variation between practices and CCGs.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose-Underuse of oral anticoagulation in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is common; however, it remains unknown how it varies geographically. The objective of this study was to evaluate geographic variation in oral anticoagulation use and in the initiation of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Methods-Using 2013 to 2014 claims data from a 5{\%} random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, we identified patients newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation who initiated NOACs (n=8659), warfarin (n=11 771) or no oral anticoagulation therapy (n=18 226) in 2013 to 2014. Each patient was assigned to 1 of the 306 Dartmouth hospital-referral regions based on his/her zip code. We constructed logistic regressions to calculate the mean adjusted probability of initiating oral anticoagulation and the mean adjusted probability of initiating an NOAC among patients on oral anticoagulation in each hospital-referral region, after adjustment for demographic, clinical, and provider characteristics and type of insurance. Finally, we computed the correlation between 2 probabilities. Results-Higher in the Midwest (0.54) and Northeast (0.54) and lowest in the South (0.47), the mean adjusted probability of initiating oral anticoagulation was 0.51, ranging from 0.32 to 0.72. The mean adjusted probability of being prescribed an NOAC among those on oral anticoagulation was 0.42 and was highest in the South (0.50) and lowest in the Midwest (0.36) and Northeast (0.39). In areas with the lower use of oral anticoagulation, patients on any oral anticoagulation therapy had a higher likelihood of being prescribed an NOAC (correlation coefficient,-0.16; P=0.006). Conclusions-Large geographic variation exists in oral anticoagulation use in atrial fibrillation. The use of oral anticoagulation is lower in the South, where the rates of stroke are unusually high. In the future, it will be important to analyze whether the high rates of stroke in the South can be partially attributed to the underuse of oral anticoagulation in this region.},

It remains unclear, however, whether higher-quality primary care improves health outcomes or reduces health inequalities.Methods We conducteda cross-sectional study examining the association between quality of cardiovascular care and coronary heart disease(CHD) outcomes in 1531 general practices in London. We calculated CHDquality achievement scores (ranging from 0 to 100) for each practiceusing the 2006-2007 data from the Quality and Outcomes Framework.We used weighted linear regression models to assess the practice-level association between the CHD quality score and CHD admissions and deaths. Findings Overall,practices with higher CHD quality achievement scores had better CHD outcomes. Each one point increase in the CHD quality achievement score was associated with 4.28 (95{\%} CI 1.19 to7.38; p-0.007) fewer admissions per 100 000 for practices serving highly deprived populations and 2.11 (95{\%} CI 0.68 to 3.55; p-0.004) feweradmissions per 100 000 for practices serving populations of average deprivation. There was no association between the CHD qualityachievement score and the CHD admissions for practices serving affluentpopulations (p-0.906). We observed a similar deprivation-dependent gradient between quality achievement and CHD deaths. Interpretation High-quality primary care is associated with improved health outcomes. This association is strongest in deprived areas, suggesting that high-quality primary care may play an important role in reducing health inequalities.},

Correlations between key variables and several different clustering analyses are presented. Evidence is provided which suggests that the depression prevalence hypothesis is flawed. Clusters of GP practices based on prescribing behaviour and disease prevalence are described and key characteristics are identified and discussed.

abstract = {Objectives: Prescribing of homeopathy still occurs in a small minority of English general practices. We hypothesised that practices that prescribe any homeopathic preparations might differ in their prescribing of other drugs. Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Setting: English primary care. Participants: English general practices. Main outcome measures: We identified practices that made any homeopathy prescriptions over six months of data. We measured associations with four prescribing and two practice quality indicators using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Only 8.5{\%} of practices (644) prescribed homeopathy between December 2016 and May 2017. Practices in the worst-scoring quartile for a composite measure of prescribing quality ({\textgreater}51.4 mean percentile) were 2.1 times more likely to prescribe homeopathy than those in the best category ({\textless}40.3) (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.6–2.8). Aggregate savings from the subset of these measures where a cost saving could be calculated were also strongly associated (highest vs. lowest quartile multivariable odds ratio: 2.9, confidence interval: 2.1–4.1). Of practices spending the most on medicines identified as ‘low value' by NHS England, 12.8{\%} prescribed homeopathy, compared to 3.9{\%} for lowest spenders (multivariable odds ratio: 2.6, confidence interval: 1.9–3.6). Of practices in the worst category for aggregated price-per-unit cost savings, 12.7{\%} prescribed homeopathy, compared to 3.5{\%} in the best category (multivariable odds ratio: 2.7, confidence interval: 1.9–3.9). Practice quality outcomes framework scores and patient recommendation rates were not associated with prescribing homeopathy (odds ratio range: 0.9–1.2). Conclusions: Even infrequent homeopathy prescribing is strongly associated with poor performance on a range of prescribing quality measures, but not with overall patient recommendation or quality outcomes framework score. The association is unlikely to be a direct causal relationship, but may reflect underlying practice features, such as the extent of respect for evidence-based practice, or poorer stewardship of the prescribing budget.},

Antipsychotic drug use among elderly with (n=34,536) and without (n=931,203) a dementia diagnosis was compared across the five regions and 98 municipalities in Denmark, adjusted for age and sex. Results: In 2012, the national prevalence of antipsychotic drug use was 20.7{\%} for elderly patients with dementia, with a national incidence of 3.9{\%}. The prevalence ranged from 17.0{\%} to 23.3{\%} in the five regions and from 7.5{\%} to 33.1{\%} in the 98 municipalities, demonstrating an over four-fold difference. Conclusion: The observed geographical variation was more pronounced at municipal level as compared to regional level, suggesting that the variation may be related to variances in clinical practice in primary care. This study highlights an urgent need for further educating professional carers and physicians to guide non-pharmacological as well as pharmacological management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly patients with dementia.},

abstract = {Background: Improved knowledge based on clinical features of chronic pain in older adults would be valuable in terms of patient-orientated approaches and would provide support for health care systems in optimizing health care resources. This study identifies subgroups based on pain and psychological symptoms among Swedish older adults in the general population and compares derived subgroups with respect to socio-demographics, health aspects, and health care costs. Methods: This cross-sectional study uses data collected from four registers and one survey. The total sample comprised 2415 individuals ≥65 years old. A two-step cluster analysis was performed. Data on pain intensity, number of pain sites, anxiety, depression, and pain catastrophizing were used as classification variables. Differences in socio-demographics, quality of life, general health, insomnia, and health care costs among the clusters were investigated. Association of the clusters with the above parameters was further evaluated using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Four major clusters were identified: Subgroup 1 (n = 325; 15{\%}) - moderate pain and high psychological symptoms; Subgroup 2 (n = 516; 22{\%}) - high pain and moderate psychological symptoms; Subgroup 3 (n = 686; 30{\%}) - low pain and moderate psychological symptoms; and Subgroup 4 (n = 767; 33{\%}) - low pain and low psychological symptoms. Significant differences were found between the four clusters with regard to age, sex, educational level, family status, quality of life, general health, insomnia, and health care costs. The multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that Subgroups 1 and 2, compared to Subgroup 4, were significantly associated with decreased quality of life, decreased general health, and increased insomnia. Subgroup 3, compared to Subgroup 4, was associated with decreased general health and increased insomnia. In addition, compared to Subgroup 4, Subgroups 1 and 2 were significantly associated with higher health care costs. Conclusions: Two high risk clusters of older adults suffering from chronic pain; one mainly based on psychological symptoms and one mainly on pain intensity and pain spread, associated with decreased quality of life and health and increased health care costs were identified. Our findings indicate that subgroup-specific treatment will improve pain management and reduce health care costs.},

abstract = {Background: The prescribing of antidepressants has been rising dramatically in developed countries. Aim: As part of an investigation into the reasons for the rise and variation in the prescribing of antidepressants, this study aimed to describe, and account for, the variation in an age-sex standardised rate of antidepressant prescribing between general practices. Design of study: Cross-sectional study involving analyses of routinely available data. Setting: A total of 983 Scottish general practices. Method: Age-sex standardised prescribing rates were calculated for each practice. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were undertaken to examine how the variation in prescribing was related to population, GP, and practice characteristics at individual practice level. Results: There was a 4.6-fold difference between the first and ninth deciles of antidepressant prescribing, standardised for registered patients' age and sex composition. The multivariate model explained 49.4{\%} of the variation. Significantly higher prescribing than expected was associated with more limiting long-term illness (highly correlated with deprivation and the single most influential factor), urban location, and a greater proportion of female GPs in the practices. Significantly lower prescribing than expected was associated with single-handed practices, a higher than average list size, a greater proportion of GP partners born outside the UK, remote rural areas, a higher proportion of patients from minority ethnic groups, a higher mean GP age, and availability of psychology services. None of the quality-of-care indicators investigated was associated with prescribing levels. Conclusion: Almost half of the variation in the prescription of antidepressants can be explained using population, GP, and practice characteristics. Initiatives to reduce the prescribing of antidepressants should consider these factors to avoid denying appropriate treatment to patients in some practices. {\textcopyright} British Journal of General Practice.},
